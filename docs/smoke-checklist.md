# Smoke checklist

Manual verification for the GUI and live upload paths, which are not
automated: doing so would need live credentials and would consume the very
upload quota the design is constrained by.

The UI itself is likewise untested by `pytest`. `tests/test_api*.py` drive
the bridge headlessly against a fake window and cover what the API *says*
and accepts; nothing under `tests/` renders the page, sends it input, opens
a native dialog, or touches the tray. There is deliberately no Playwright
and no browser toolchain. `scripts/js_smoke.js` loads every page's modules
under node and fails on anything an IIFE throws at top level — it proves a
screen is not an inert copy of itself, and nothing more. **This checklist
is the only verification any of the rest gets.**

Run on Windows against a real install before each release.

## Operational legibility and review clarity

Check at 840×625 CSS pixels and at a wider window. Browser checks supplement,
but do not replace, these Windows/WebView2 checks.

- [ ] **Bookmark help names an action, not a background feature.** Format
      Enforcer has its own explanation beside the binding. Its capture and Edit
      controls expose that description to assistive technology after leaving and
      reopening Bookmarks. The category field still accepts numeric IDs, and
      General's examples are clearly not an exhaustive inventory of EVE tools.

- [ ] **Editable offline names remain readable.** In Settings → Previews,
      scroll into the offline roster. The sticky Offline heading remains visible;
      names do not look disabled, and Configure still opens the correct row.
- [ ] **The Fittings-detail capture shows the open fitting.** After the Alliance
      capture, `fittings-detail` must bring the expanded Rifter row into view with
      its module racks rendered. A collapsed, loading or incomplete detail must
      be recorded as a failed shot rather than saved as a successful PNG.
- [ ] **Copy status is not lost in metadata.** In Fittings, a non-deployable fit
      keeps its status readable with a long fitting name. Copy results clearly
      associate each status and recovery instruction with its target character.
- [ ] **Removal outcomes identify the character.** With controlled failed,
      incomplete-cleanup and lost-reply responses, confirm the notice names the
      selected pilot even after a roster refresh. Only a confirmed removal says
      the pilot was removed. Incomplete cleanup directs the user to restart
      Wingman; it does not claim that refreshing the roster repairs saved state.
- [ ] **The copy limit describes additions, not selected fittings.** Guidance is
      visible before review. More than 20 selected fits can still be reviewed
      when enough already exist on the targets; more than 20 actual additions
      across targets remain refused. Nothing is retried automatically.
- [ ] **Setup review keeps consequences visible.** Check portable setup and
      native overview YAML imports. Recipient, new profile, changes, retained
      settings, account consequences and any required ship-label choice remain
      visible outside the detail disclosures. Open those disclosures by keyboard.
      A layout caveat appears once for a layout import, never for overview-only
      YAML. Review focus has breathing room, and commit controls remain reachable.
- [ ] **Formation scale labels stay separate from probes.** Check an empty,
      origin-only and multi-probe formation. Rotate the drawing: the scale key
      remains readable and identifies ring order without overlapping probe labels.
      Coordinates, range values and save behavior are unchanged.

## Install
- [ ] Installer runs without an admin prompt
- [ ] Installer wizard, Start Menu entry, and Add/Remove Programs all read
      **FlyGD Wingman**
- [ ] **The FightRecorder task is checked by default and does what it
      says.** With OBS Studio installed, run the installer with the
      "Install the FightRecorder plugin into OBS Studio" box ticked:
      expected, one copy of `obs-fightrecorder.dll` in OBS's
      `obs-plugins\64bit` directory (default
      `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit\`), and a
      FightRecorder line on the Finished page saying where it went.
      Writing into Program Files may raise exactly ONE UAC prompt;
      declining it lands on the Finished-page note, not a failed
      install. Run the installer a SECOND time without any upstream
      release change: the DLL must be left alone (byte-identical means
      it already matches), with no UAC prompt. With OBS not installed,
      the Finished page says it was skipped. Unticking the box installs
      no DLL. The DLL is NOT part of Wingman's uninstall — removing
      Wingman leaves the plugin with OBS, where it still works.
- [ ] Start Menu shortcut launches the app
- [ ] With "start at login" checked, the app appears after a reboot
- [ ] Uninstall removes the app and leaves `%LOCALAPPDATA%` state intact
- [ ] **Upgrading from a pre-4.0 build replaces it rather than leaving two
      copies.** Install a pre-rename build (product name "OBS YouTube
      Uploader"), sign in and change a setting, then run the 4.0 installer
      over it. Expected: Add/Remove Programs lists exactly ONE entry, now
      named FlyGD Wingman; `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FlyGD Wingman\settings.json` and
      `token.json` exist with the same preferences, and
      `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OBSYouTubeUploader\` is gone. This is no longer a
      same-AppId upgrade the way the 2024 rebrand was: `AppId` itself
      changed to `FlyGD Wingman` in 4.0, so `RemovePredecessor()` in
      installer.iss uninstalls the old install by its old
      `AppId=OBS YouTube Uploader` first, and `paths.migrate_state_dir()`
      renames the state directory on first launch. If two entries appear,
      or the old state directory is still there afterward, one of those two
      steps is broken.
- [ ] **A normal in-place Wingman upgrade preserves current settings and
      sign-in.** Install the previous 4.x release, change a visible setting,
      sign in, quit Wingman, and save the state before running the candidate:

      ```powershell
      $State = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "FlyGD Wingman"
      Copy-Item "$State\settings.json" "$env:TEMP\wingman-settings-before.json"
      Copy-Item "$State\token.json" "$env:TEMP\wingman-token-before.json"
      $Installer = Get-ChildItem .\dist\FlyGD-Wingman-Setup-*.exe |
        Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1
      Start-Process -FilePath $Installer.FullName -Wait
      ```

      Expected: the visible Inno wizard recognises the existing install and
      replaces it in place; Add/Remove Programs still has exactly one FlyGD
      Wingman entry; the changed setting remains selected after launch; and
      `Compare-Object (Get-Content "$env:TEMP\wingman-token-before.json")
      (Get-Content "$State\token.json")` prints nothing. The application
      remains signed in. This is the ordinary same-AppId update path, separate
      from the pre-4.0 identity migration above.
- [ ] **Upgrading resets the "start at login" task to checked, even if the
      3.x user had turned it off.** Because `AppId` changed in 4.0, Inno
      treats the install as fresh and does not carry forward [Tasks]
      selections from the predecessor; `startup` has no `unchecked` flag, so
      it defaults ticked on every install, upgrade included. Expected and
      not a bug: install 3.x, untick start-at-login (or turn it off in
      Settings), then upgrade to 4.0 without touching the wizard's task
      list. Start at login is back ON afterward. Call this out in the 4.0
      release notes so a user who wants it off knows to untick it in the
      wizard or turn it off again in Settings.
- [ ] **Upgrade from 3.x with the old build running.** Install 3.5.1, launch
      it, and leave it in the tray. Install 4.0.0 and launch it. Expected: it
      exits immediately without a window. Close the 3.x tray icon, launch
      again. Expected: it starts, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FlyGD Wingman\` exists,
      `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OBSYouTubeUploader\` is gone, and you are still signed
      in to YouTube.
- [ ] Window title bar and tray-icon tooltip both read **FlyGD Wingman**
- [ ] A "new recording(s) ready to upload" notification is titled
      **FlyGD Wingman**

## Guided updater native harness

Run the checkout-only fixture before each release on Windows; the complete
commands and expected output are in `tests/manual/README.md`. These checks must
use `tests/manual/update_fixture.iss`, never an installed application binary.

```powershell
iscc /O"$PWD\dist" tests\manual\update_fixture.iss
$Fixture = Join-Path $PWD "dist\Wingman-Update-Harness-Setup.exe"
$SourceUrl = "https://github.com/elboaf/FlyGD-Wingman/releases/download/v0.0.0/test.exe"
```

- [ ] **Injected download modes preserve production validation and cleanup.**
      Run `uv run python tests\manual\update_harness.py serve --mode complete`,
      then repeat with `truncated` and `checksum-mismatch`. Expected: complete
      prints verified identity/size/digest and marker create/remove; truncated
      fails with `code=size`; checksum mismatch fails with `code=checksum`;
      both faults print `partial retention: none`; every run prints
      `temporary staging root removed: yes` and makes no network request.
- [ ] **Attachment Services handles the fixture and preserves MOTW where
      supported.** Run: `uv run python
      tests\manual\update_harness.py attachment
      --i-understand-this-launches-a-test-exe $Fixture $SourceUrl`, then
      `Get-Item -LiteralPath $Fixture -Stream *`. Expected on a filesystem and
      policy that support Mark-of-the-Web: identity, size and digest print and
      `Zone.Identifier` is present and listed. This is the real Attachment
      Services path, not a fabricated alternate data stream. A local policy
      rejection or quarantine remains a typed failure rather than a reason to
      bypass it.
- [ ] **The protected handle wins a real replacement race.** Run:
      `uv run python tests\manual\update_harness.py lock-race
      --i-understand-this-launches-a-test-exe $Fixture`. Expected:
      `safe retention: replacement denied (winerror=5)` or the same line with
      `winerror=32`, followed by unchanged identity, size, and SHA-256. The
      command prints the actual code; success, any other code, timeout, or
      mutation must fail. It races only a temporary staged copy and removes
      that staging root.
- [ ] **The fixture mutex produces deterministic prompt/no-prompt runs.** In
      one terminal run
      `uv run python tests\manual\update_harness.py mutex-holder`; in another,
      open `dist\Wingman-Update-Harness-Setup.exe`. Expected: Inno's close/OK
      prompt. Press Enter in the holder, open the fixture again, and expect no
      app-close prompt.
- [ ] **Verified ShellExecute transfers and closes its process handle.** Run:

      ```powershell
      uv run python tests\manual\update_harness.py shell-launch `
        --i-understand-this-launches-a-test-exe `
        dist\Wingman-Update-Harness-Setup.exe `
        https://github.com/elboaf/FlyGD-Wingman/releases/download/v0.0.0/test.exe
      ```

      Expected: the normal visible Inno fixture starts, a non-zero process
      handle prints, and `process handle closed: yes` follows. Windows may show
      a SmartScreen/Mark-of-the-Web reputation warning depending on local
      policy and the fixture's reputation. If it appears, choose **More info →
      Run anyway** only for this compiled no-payload fixture. Neither the
      harness nor Wingman disables zone checks. Repeat with the fixture mutex
      held to get the close/OK prompt. For the deterministic launch-failure
      command, create and remove the required basename before invoking the
      harness:

      ```powershell
      $Missing = Join-Path $env:TEMP "Wingman-Update-Harness-Setup.exe"
      Copy-Item -LiteralPath $Fixture -Destination $Missing -Force
      Remove-Item -LiteralPath $Missing
      uv run python tests\manual\update_harness.py shell-launch `
        --i-understand-this-launches-a-test-exe $Missing $SourceUrl
      $LASTEXITCODE
      ```

      Expected: no process opens, `updater failure` prints, and the exit code
      is 1. The successful path must use real Attachment Services and retain
      Mark-of-the-Web where supported, must leave zone checks enabled, and must
      show the normal visible installer; reputation UI itself is policy- and
      reputation-dependent.

## WebView2 runtime

The app renders its entire UI in WebView2 and has no fallback. These items
exist because the failure mode is silent: without the runtime, pywebview
logs a load failure, `webview.start()` returns normally, and the process
exits **0** — no window, no error, no crash dialog, and a success code.

- [ ] **The installer skips the bootstrapper when the runtime is already
      there.** Run with `/VERYSILENT /LOG=%TEMP%\i.log`, then
      `findstr /C:"WebView2:" %TEMP%\i.log`. Expected: exactly one line,
      "runtime already present, skipping the bootstrapper", and no
      `bootstrapper exited with` line. A bootstrapper that runs on every
      install is a several-minute delay nobody asked for.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: a missing runtime produces a native dialog and a
      NON-ZERO exit.** Testable without a VM, exactly as spike Q7 did it:
      point `WEBVIEW2_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_FOLDER` at an empty directory for
      one process and launch the installed exe from `cmd`, then read
      `echo %ERRORLEVEL%`. Expected: a native Windows message box naming
      the Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime and its download URL, and a
      non-zero exit code. **An exit code of 0 is the defect** — that is the
      pre-refactor behaviour, and it means the pre-flight check is not
      running before `webview.start()`. Nothing is uninstalled by this test
      and the variable dies with the shell.
- [ ] **The pre-flight message box is readable and dismissible.** Confirm
      it has a title, names the runtime by its full name, shows a URL that
      can be selected or typed out, and closes on OK without leaving a
      process behind (check Task Manager).
- [ ] **CLEAN VM ONLY — DEFERRED, no VM available: the bootstrapper actually
      installs the runtime.**
      On a fresh Windows VM with no WebView2 runtime, run the installer.
      Expected: the wizard pauses briefly at the end, the log shows "runtime
      absent, running the bundled Evergreen bootstrapper" followed by
      "runtime installed successfully", and the app launches and renders.
      There is no way to fake this on a machine that already has the runtime
      — the `WEBVIEW2_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_FOLDER` trick fools the loader, not
      the registry. **Leave this unticked rather than assuming it; it is the
      largest untested risk in the release.**
- [ ] **CLEAN VM ONLY — DEFERRED, no VM available: an offline install fails
      honestly.** Same VM,
      network disconnected. Expected: the install still completes, ONE error
      dialog explains the runtime could not be installed and gives the
      download URL, the Finished page repeats the warning, and the app is
      installed rather than rolled back. Reconnect, install the runtime by
      hand, and confirm the app then starts with no reinstallation.

## First run

**Check what tree the launcher points at before you check anything else.**
`run-first-run.bat` ends with a `cd /d` to the tree it runs, and for an
unknown period it pointed at `.claude/worktrees/nav-restructure` — six
commits behind main — so every hand verification of the first-run screen
through it verified the screen that had already been replaced. Fixed
2026-08-25; the old line is kept in `run-first-run.bat.bak` with the
reason in a comment above the replacement. The launcher's target tree is
part of what these items depend on, so it is part of what you check.

**The cheap tell:** if the card has a `Set this up later` link beside
`Continue`, you are on main. If it does not, the launcher is pointed
somewhere stale and nothing on that screen is worth reviewing.
(`run-test-build.bat` points at the repository root and is unaffected.)

- [ ] Recording folder is pre-filled from OBS config without being asked
- [ ] **The FightRecorder card reports locally and only checks the
      network when asked.** Settings, the card under Recording folder.
      On load the status line reads from disk only — "Up to date.",
      "Not installed.", or "OBS Studio was not detected." — and no
      GitHub request has fired. Press **Check for updates**: the line
      gains a release tag and an update verdict ("An update is
      available (v1.1.2)." / "Up to date."). With the machine offline,
      the check reports that it could not reach GitHub instead of
      clearing the installed/not-installed state. **Install** /
      **Update** appears only when there is something to install; on a
      Program Files OBS it raises one UAC prompt, and declining it
      produces a status-line error, never a crash. After a successful
      update the line names the new release and OBS's plugin directory
      holds the new DLL (verify the bytes changed if the release did).
- [ ] With OBS absent, the in-app first-run folder screen appears instead of
      a bare OS dialog — see the LOAD-BEARING first-run item under
      Settings > Folder dialogs for the full check.
      **How to actually get here**, since deleting settings.json is not
      enough: `resolve_recording_dir` tries the stored setting, then OBS's
      OWN config, and only returns None when BOTH fail. On a machine with
      OBS installed, detection succeeds and first run is skipped — which is
      correct, and is why this item goes unchecked unless it says how.
      Clear the stored setting and point `APPDATA` at an empty folder;
      `obsconfig.profiles_root` reads `%APPDATA%\obs-studio\basic\profiles`
      and finds nothing. Both are per-process, so a real install is
      untouched.
- [ ] **The first-run screen asks ONLY for the recording folder.** It does
      not ask about the EVE tools: those are on for everyone, because in
      practice the people who install this play EVE. Someone who wants the
      plain uploader turns them off in Settings > General, which is checked
      under The Settings rail.
- [ ] **Set this up later leaves the screen.** With the first-run screen
      showing (the recipe above), click **Set this up later**. Expected:
      the Uploader opens, the title-bar destinations and the gear are back,
      and the Uploader shows its empty state rather than a blank list — an
      empty list with no rows and no empty state is the inert screen that
      reads as broken. Confirm `"first_run_skipped": true` is in
      settings.json before doing anything else.
      A recording folder configures the UPLOADER half, and the two halves
      are meant to be independent — someone here for previews and bookmark
      keybinds must not be gated on it every launch.
- [ ] **…and the EVE half genuinely works from there.** After skipping,
      open Settings > Bookmarks and Settings > Previews and confirm both
      are usable with no recording folder configured. This is the whole
      reason the skip exists; a skip that reaches an unusable app is the
      same gate one screen further in.
- [ ] **A skipped first run is not asked again.** Quit and relaunch with
      `APPDATA` still pointing at the empty folder. Expected: the first-run
      screen does NOT appear.
      Then choose a folder in Settings › Uploading and confirm
      `first_run_skipped` returns to `false` in settings.json: choosing a
      folder answers the question the skip deferred.
- [ ] **The screen says what Wingman is.** Read the two paragraphs above
      the field as a new user would. They must name the EVE half — previews
      and bookmark keybinds — before asking for an OBS folder, and say the
      folder can be set up later. This is the only place in the app that
      introduces the product, and it is what makes the skip read as an
      offer rather than as a way to break the setup.
- [ ] **Detect says so when it finds nothing.** With `APPDATA` pointed at
      an empty folder, press **Detect**. Expected: the note under the field
      changes to say Detect could not find a recording folder and to use
      Browse. It must not sit there unchanged — a silent Detect and a dead
      button look identical, and this is the screen with no way out.
- [ ] **The note comes back after an error.** Type a path that does not
      exist and press **Continue**. Expected: the note is replaced by the
      refusal, in the error colour. Now type one more character in the
      field. Expected: the note returns to explaining Detect. Losing that
      explanation for the rest of the session is the behaviour this
      replaces.
- [ ] **Cancelling Browse keeps the path already found.** Press Detect or
      Browse until the field holds a path, then press **Browse…** again and
      cancel the picker. Expected: the field still holds the path and
      Continue is still enabled.
- [ ] **The placeholder is an example.** With the field empty, it reads
      like a Windows path rather than reporting that no folder is chosen.
- [ ] Existing recordings do NOT produce a notification on first launch
- [ ] **Missing ffmpeg disables Stitch instead of breaking the app.**
      Rename `bin\ffmpeg.exe` inside the install directory so it fails to
      resolve, then start the app. Expected: the app still starts and
      lists recordings normally; the Stitch checkbox is disabled with an
      explanatory "(ffmpeg not found — stitching unavailable)" label.
      Restore the binary afterward. **The warning now lives in the upload
      panel, directly under the Stitch checkbox, not in a full-width bar** —
      check the whole sentence is readable there and wraps rather than being
      cut off at the panel edge, at 100% and again at 150%.

## Look and feel

- [ ] **The screenshot shooter produces a complete set.** Run
      `scripts/shoot_screens.py` with Wingman idle. Expected: every planned
      screen for the current EVE-gate state is captured (or every non-EVE screen
      plus an explicit "EVE gate off, skipped:" line naming every EVE-gated
      screen), every PNG showing populated content,
      `manifest.json` naming the checkout you meant to shoot, and the
      previously-running Wingman restored. The Previews captures cover its
      top, middle, bottom, open Configure detail, Copy picker, groups, and
      840x625 floor rather than presenting the top of a long nested scroller
      as the complete screen. The floor shot starts at the collapsed roster
      heading; a detail left open by an earlier stage is a capture defect.
      The separate saved-crop floor capture deliberately opens Configure and
      shows **Reselect…**, saved-crop status and controls. Profiles also has
      fixture-backed captures of the populated Formations editor, formation
      import review with a name conflict, Share setup from a synthetic confirmed
      pair, and Import setup review before Create. Check their manifest `fixture`
      annotations and verify no Save/Create/clipboard action runs. These are
      synthetic presentation checks, not acceptance of real EVE file operations
      or native crop behavior; the dedicated interaction checks remain required.
      A blank screen in the set is a real defect, not a capture artifact -- one
      bad handler name silently disables every registration below it.

### Window chrome
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: the custom title bar drags the window.** The OS title
      bar is gone; dragging is the page's `pywebview-drag-region`. Grab the
      bar and move the window across two monitors. Expected: the window
      follows with no lag. This is the single most visible thing that breaks
      with a frameless window and it has no automated coverage of any kind.
- [ ] **Windows snap, as far as it goes.** `Win+Up` must maximize. `Win+Left`
      and `Win+Right` are KNOWN NOT TO WORK and are not a regression:
      half-snap needs `WS_THICKFRAME`, which a frameless window does not
      have, so Windows does not treat this window as snappable however it
      hit-tests. Only `WM_NCCALCSIZE` or giving up the custom title bar
      would recover it. Check `Win+Up` still works; do not file the others.

      Dragging the title bar to a screen edge does not snap either, and
      never has — pywebview moves the window with `SetWindowPos`
      (`util.py:280`), which never enters the OS drag loop that snap hooks
      into. An earlier version of this checklist expected it to "snap
      normally", which was never true. Confirmed against 3.0.0.
- [ ] **Resizing at 150% or 175% scaling — NOT YET VERIFIED.** Everything
      above was checked on a single 4K display at 200%, so `scale = 2.0` is
      the only factor real hardware has ever exercised; 1.5 exists only in
      the unit tests' arithmetic. Repeat the edge drags on a scaled display
      when one is available. Expected: the band stays the same apparent
      thickness. If it does not, the inset and the hit-test have diverged,
      which presents as "resizing is fiddly on that laptop" rather than as
      a bug.
- [ ] **The drag region excludes the controls.** Press and hold on the gear,
      minimize and close in turn and move the pointer a few pixels.
      Expected: none of them drags the window; each still activates on
      release.
- [ ] **The window drags by its logo.** Press and hold on the round emblem
      at the far left of the title bar and move the pointer. Expected: the
      window moves, exactly as it does from the empty space beside
      "WINGMAN". The mark is an `<img>` inside the drag region and images
      are natively draggable, so the failure mode is that dragging there
      picks up a ghost of the image instead of the window -- making the one
      spot users aim at most look like dead surface. `style.css` sets
      `pointer-events: none` and `-webkit-user-drag: none` to prevent it;
      this is the only check that would catch either being dropped.
- [ ] **The title-bar controls do what they say.** The gear opens the
      Settings route in the same window (not a second OS window), minimize
      minimizes to the taskbar, and close HIDES to the tray rather than
      exiting — confirm the process is still running and the tray icon is
      still there.
- [ ] **The window opens fully on screen.** Launch on the primary monitor,
      again with a second monitor attached, then again after disconnecting
      it. Expected: fully visible and its title bar reachable every time.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: every edge and corner resizes.** Drag all four edges
      and all four corners in turn; check the pointer becomes the sizing
      arrow BEFORE the drag, not after. Expected: all eight respond.
      Frameless windows have no OS resize border — this one is a band of
      form surface left by insetting the web view, so a change to that
      inset, to the page's own edges, or to DPI handling can take the whole
      thing away silently. There is no automated coverage: CI is ubuntu and
      cannot run a message pump.
- [ ] **The window will not shrink below its floor.** Drag any edge inward
      as far as it goes. Expected: it stops at 840x625 logical, and at that
      size nothing in either pane is cut off or unreachable. Those numbers
      were measured off the real page, not derived — if the layout changes,
      they need re-measuring, and `min_size` in `ui/window.py` needs
      updating with them. The minimum resolves in LOGICAL units, so this is
      840x625 CSS px at every display scaling, not 840/scale — see
      `DESIGN.md`. Verified at 200%: the floor capture is 839x621 CSS.
- [ ] **Maximize leaves the taskbar alone.** Maximize with `Win+Up` — NOT by
      dragging the title bar to the top edge, which does not maximize and
      never has (see the snap item above). Expected: it fills the work area
      only, and the taskbar stays visible and clickable. A borderless
      window maximizes over the taskbar unless it is explicitly clamped.
- [ ] **The inset band is not ugly.** Look at the edge of the window against
      the page. Expected: the band reads as part of the window, not as a
      misaligned frame. It matches the page background at the sides and
      bottom, but it sits above the title bar's gradient at the top, which
      is the one place it can look wrong.
- [ ] **Scrollbars are the app's, not Windows'.** Scroll a long list. The
      scrollbar must be the styled thin one, not the classic grey Windows
      scrollbar.

### Typography and layout
- [ ] **The three type steps are visibly distinct** — panel/section headings
      largest, filenames and field text body, column headers and hints
      smallest.
- [ ] **Column headers sit below the data, not above it.** The header row
      must read as quieter than the filenames beneath it. Deliberate,
      carried over from 2.2.0: headers label the data, they are not the data.
- [ ] **Machine text is monospace.** Paths, the webhook field and the
      webhook summary render in the monospace face; prose does not.
- [ ] **Display scaling at 100%, 125%, 150% and 200%.** Restart at each.
      Expected: text sharp AND the right apparent size next to Notepad;
      neither route opens larger than the screen; Title, Description,
      Stitch, the no-webhook note, the summary (select a row first — it is
      hidden while nothing is selected) and Upload all fully visible with
      nothing clipped. Title and Description must both fill the card's
      full width and match each other; they were 198px and 177px of a
      286px box until round 5's U3. (Retry is absent until a failure —
      see The list and Upload. The combat-log CHECKBOX is gone — logs are
      unconditional now and a configured webhook is what decides the post;
      what remains is the sentence.) The upload panel is deliberately
      narrower below 840 CSS px — 248px — so check the longest prose in
      it wraps rather than being cut off at the panel edge: clear the
      webhook first so the two-line no-webhook note is showing, which is
      the longest string the panel ever holds. NOTE: the viewport floor is
      840 CSS px at every scaling. (The 220px step is gone — it lived in a
      `max-width: 607px` block that could never fire.) 248px is
      reachable only at SOME scalings: `max-width: 839px` matches at 200%,
      where DPI rounding puts the floor at 839 CSS, and not at 100%, where
      it is 840. Expect the panel at 320px at 100% and 248px at 200%, at
      the same window size. That is a known defect (`DESIGN.md`), not
      something to verify as correct — record which you saw.
- [ ] **Nothing is clipped at the minimum window size, and Upload is above
      the fold.** Drag the window down to its floor (840x625 logical) with
      the webhook CLEARED and every row selected — that is the tallest the
      panel ever gets. Expected: no scrollbar inside the panel at all, and
      **Upload fully visible with its label**, not a sliver of accent at
      the pane's bottom edge. It used to be clipped there: the panel was
      two cards, and the most-pressed control in the app was last in a
      stack of a title, a 96px description, two checkboxes, a three-line
      webhook explanation, a summary, a second card heading and a line of
      prose. It is one card now, and **Delete selected** has moved to the
      list footer beside Select all / Select none, where the files it
      deletes are.
- [ ] **Settings rows stay usable at the window floor.** With the window at
      its floor, open Settings > Uploading. Expected: the recording-folder
      path and the masked webhook are both wide enough to read, with their
      buttons still beside them on the row.
      **This item used to read "at 150% scaling, with the window at its
      floor (560 CSS px)" and could not be performed.** The floor is 840
      CSS px at EVERY scaling, so a 560px viewport does not exist and
      neither does the stacked-label collapse it was checking: the
      `max-width: 720px` block that moves each label above its field
      cannot fire through the window. The labels are always in their
      shared 118px column. If you need to see the collapsed state, it is
      reachable only through the `?dev=1` harness in a resizable browser
      — and whether a rule that the window can never reach should still
      exist is the owning lane's call, not this checklist's.
- [ ] **Profiles matches Settings at the floor.** Still at the floor, open
      Profiles. Its rows carry `class="settings"` as well, so whatever
      Settings does they must do — the shared label column exists so the
      two screens line up, and a rule that reached only one of them would
      be worse than reaching neither. Check the inline hint under a field
      and any refusal message line up with the field. (This item used to
      check a stacked collapse that the window cannot reach; see above.)
- [ ] **The bind rows are stacked, and the two lists agree.** Open Settings >
      Bookmarks and read the keybind list, then Settings > Previews. Expected:
      each action or character name on its own line with its keybind button,
      Clear and Edit... on the line below — "Convert EvE-Scout Bookmarks" and
      "Finisher: C13 (shattered)" readable in one line each. Then check the
      thing this item exists for: **the keybind button starts at the same
      distance from the card's left edge in both sections**, as do Clear and
      Edit.... Do it at the floor AND at a comfortable width; the geometry
      must not change with either.
      Round 3's B1 is why. Each list was its own grid whose first column was
      sized to that list's own longest label, so Bookmarks put the button
      103.4 CSS px further right than Previews — and Previews' offset moved
      between sessions, because it tracked whichever characters were logged
      in. Stacking is the only shape that depends on no content. It is also
      no longer conditional: it used to live in a `max-width: 720px` block
      that the window can never reach (the floor is 840), so on the two
      lists that most needed it the collapse never fired at all.
      Round 5's C8 added a SECOND shape to the Bookmarks list and did not
      change this rule: the ten finishers and the four tags now render in a
      two-column block under a group heading, so their bind buttons sit at
      two x-positions rather than one. Check that both are content-
      INDEPENDENT — column one starts at the card's left edge, exactly
      where Previews' does, and column two is offset by a fixed 256px track
      that no label can move. The four rows above `FINISHERS` are still the
      original one-per-line shape and are the ones to compare against
      Previews directly.
      tests/test_page_conventions.py now requires the two grids to declare
      the same columns and both names to take their own line, so a drift
      fails the suite rather than waiting for a screenshot.

### The list
- [ ] **Clicking ANYWHERE on a row toggles it,** not just the checkbox cell.
      Rows accumulate — clicking a second must not clear the first.
- [ ] **Select all and Select none repaint every checkbox,** not just the
      summary. The two must never disagree.
- [ ] **The recording count sits beside `Select all` / `Select none`** in
      the list footer, with `Open folder` and `Delete selected` grouped at
      the right. At the 840x625 floor the footer wraps and `Delete
      selected` takes a second line, right-aligned — check it is reachable
      and does not overlap the row above.
- [ ] **Click, Enter and Space sort every column and show direction** on the
      active control only. Tab to each header and use Enter, then Space: each
      must follow the same ascending/descending cycle as click and Space must
      not scroll the page. In the Chromium accessibility pane, every header is
      a button (not an orphaned ARIA table header); the active button's
      accessible name announces ascending or descending and an inactive button
      announces only what it sorts. Sorting is pure client state; a sort that
      round-trips to Python or clears the selection is a defect.
- [ ] **The leftmost header is a bare check, not a checkbox.** Clicking it
      SORTS by checked state — it must not select or clear anything.
- [ ] **Sorting does not affect upload order or stitch order.** Sort by each
      column, select out of displayed order, upload with Stitch off then on.
      The `(1/n)` numbering and clip order follow the underlying data.
- [ ] **Sorting by Length while durations are still loading.** Delete
      `durations.json`, launch against a large folder, click Length while
      rows read "…". Pending rows sort together and each fills in where it
      sits — rows do NOT re-order under the cursor as results arrive.
- [ ] **Sorting by Length puts an hour-long recording above a 59-minute
      one.** Needs at least one recording over an hour, so it renders
      `1:03:09` rather than `17:07`. list.js sorts this column by parsing
      its own rendered cell, so a format it cannot parse does not fail
      loudly — those rows silently sort as "not measured", down with the
      `?` and `…` ones. Round 3 gave the format its hours field and
      widened the parser in the same change; this is what notices if they
      ever come apart again.

      **Run this on a COLD folder**, i.e. with `durations.json` deleted, and
      then again on a warm one. The two used to be different products and
      that is exactly what the item is now for: until round 5 `onDuration`
      pushed a raw float, so a cell filled in by a probe completing during
      the run read `3789` while the same recording read `1:03:09` after a
      restart — and the sort, which parses the cell, did nothing at all on
      a cold folder. Warm-only runs are what hid it for four rounds, so a
      cold run is the load-bearing half now.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: arrow keys move focus and Space toggles.** Tab in,
      move with ↑/↓, press Space. Focus is visibly distinct from "checked",
      Space toggles exactly the focused row, and Space does NOT scroll. Then
      trigger a rebuild (delete a file, or save Settings) and confirm the
      keyboard still works without touching the mouse.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: the row context menu opens and dismisses cleanly.**
      Dismiss by clicking away; by Escape; and by right-clicking a different
      row while the first is open. After each, the window still responds and
      only one menu is ever visible.
- [ ] **Copy link and Open in browser work and grey out correctly.** Both
      work on a row with a completed upload, both greyed without one, and
      Copy link puts a URL that actually opens on the clipboard.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: double-click opens the link and LEAVES THE CHECKBOX SELECTION UNCHANGED.**
      Tick two rows, double-click a third with a link: the browser opens and
      the third row is still unticked. Repeat on a row that starts ticked —
      still ticked afterwards. A row left changed here is a defect, not
      cosmetic.
- [ ] **Newly announced recordings are pre-checked, scrolled into view, and
      visibly highlighted** — even when below the fold.
- [ ] **Selected, focused and uploaded rows are distinguishable** from one
      another at a glance.
- [ ] **Three Length glyphs, three different sentences.** Hover a `?`, a
      `—` and a `…` cell. `?` blames the FILE ("ffprobe could not open this
      file"); `—` blames the INSTALL ("ffprobe was not found", with
      reinstalling as the way out); `…` says "Measuring length…". The first
      two shared the `?` glyph until round 2, so a build with no ffprobe
      accused every recording in the folder of being unreadable.
      **To see `—` on purpose:** run from a source checkout with no
      `packaging/bin/ffprobe.exe` fetched and no ffprobe on PATH. Every row
      shows `—`, and the selection summary reads `0:00+` — the `+` is
      required, because without it the line states a confident zero for a
      108.8 MB recording.
- [ ] **Hovering the link glyph explains both gestures,** and no tooltip
      appears over an empty Link cell, a filename, a header, or empty space.
- [ ] **The list at the minimum window width.** Drag the window to its
      floor. Expected: **five** columns — check, Filename, Size, Length,
      Link — with **Age absent**, and the filename shown WHOLE, with
      no ellipsis. Widen the window past **923 CSS px** and Age comes
      back, making six. (923 is derived, not eyeballed:
      test_uploader_page.py computes it from the declared tracks and fails
      if the two disagree.)
      **Age giving way at the floor is the point, not a defect.** At
      840 the six-column layout put the Filename track on a 120px floor
      while an OBS filename measures 205px, so the column carrying the
      row's identity was truncated to "Fight 2026-08-24 17-57-…" — losing
      the seconds, the only characters that tell one row from another —
      while Modified sat intact beside it carrying the same timestamp in a
      friendlier form. The name floor is 212px now and Age is what
      yields. If you see six columns at the floor, or an ellipsis in a
      filename, that is the regression.
      Age is the restored form of that column and it sheds for the same
      reason its predecessor did — it is the metadata whose fact the
      filename most nearly carries already, so it costs the least. What
      round 3 got wrong was concluding it therefore cost nothing at every
      width; above 923 it has a track of its own and earns it.
      **This item used to demand three checks at three viewports (840 at
      100%, 672 at 125%, 560 at 150%) and two of them do not exist.** The
      floor is 840 CSS px at every scaling, so there is one width to
      check, not three, and the tier below the floor (`max-width: 767px`,
      dropping Size and Length) cannot be reached by resizing the window
      at any scaling.
      Do still restart at each scaling for the reasons in the Display
      scaling item — apparent size, sharpness, clipping — but the CSS
      width does not move.
      In every case: NO horizontal scrollbar, no column cut in half at the
      pane edge, and the header sits over the right column — a header that
      has kept a cell its rows have dropped is the specific failure the
      shared grid template exists to prevent.
      Widen the window back up and confirm the columns come back.
- [ ] **The Age column reads as relative time, not a timestamp.**
      Widen the window past 923 CSS px first — Age is not rendered at
      the floor (see the item above). It
      must say "just now" / "23h ago" / "yesterday" / "4d ago" for the last
      week, and a bare date ("Aug 13", or "2025 Nov 02" outside this year)
      beyond it. It shows the file's MTIME, which is why it must not look
      like the recording timestamp already in the filename: for a copied or
      remuxed recording the two legitimately differ by minutes or hours,
      and printing both as clock times made the app look like it was
      contradicting itself. The header must read **Age**, not "Modified"
      or "Date" — "Modified" was the absolute column this replaced, and
      the values under it are not modification times.
      The widest string it can render is the out-of-year form
      "2025 Nov 02", and the track is sized to exactly that (84px). If a
      year-prefixed row shows an ellipsis, the track has been narrowed or
      the bundled Inter failed to load and a wider fallback is in use.
- [ ] **Sorting by Age still orders newest-first.** Widen the window
      until Age is showing, then click it.
      The order must follow the underlying mtime, NOT the rendered text — a
      text sort would put "2d ago" before "3h ago" and "Aug" before "Dec".
      Check with a folder holding both a recording from today and one over
      a week old.
- [ ] **The filename column does not swallow the window.** Widen the window
      well past the default. Filename must stop growing once it fits its
      text, keeping Age/Size/Length/Link near it, rather than
      stretching and pushing them to the far edge with a gap in the middle.
- [ ] **The empty state names the folder it watched.** Point the app at a
      folder with no recordings in it. Expected: "No recordings in
      &lt;the full path&gt;." with the path in the monospace face, and a second
      line offering Open folder and a Settings direction. The current hint
      still names the retired Folders entry; use Settings › Uploading.
      It must name the actual folder, not "the watched folder" — this is the screen a
      first-run user lands on straight after nominating one, so it is where
      a wrong pick shows up, and it was the one place that did not say
      which folder it meant.
      Then check the other half: with NO folder configured at all (the
      skipped first run recipe under First run), it must read "No recording
      folder is set yet." and point at Settings rather than naming an empty
      path.
      At 150%, confirm a long path wraps inside the pane instead of running
      off the edge — a Windows path has no spaces to break at.
- [ ] **The panel's empty-folder note reads as its own paragraph.** Same
      empty folder, now look at the PANEL. Expected: "There are no
      recordings in this folder yet…" with a clear blank line between it
      and the `Title` label below. It used to sit exactly one line-pitch
      above the label — measured 0px of margin — so `Title` read as the
      paragraph's third line. The form stays rendered and typeable on
      purpose (typing a title is an action that can be carried out); this
      is spacing only.
- [ ] **Neither field repeats its own label.** Look at `Title` and
      `Description` with the panel empty. Expected: no placeholder text
      inside either box. `Title` used to hold "Title for this upload"
      under a card headed "This upload" and a label reading "Title" —
      the same word three times. Optionality now sits on the
      `Description (optional)` label, where it survives the field being
      typed in.
- [ ] **The stitch checkbox explains itself by being greyed out.** Select
      one recording. Expected: `Stitch selected into one video` is greyed
      and there is NO sentence under it. The old two-line hint sat between
      the last field typed and the button clicked, stating a precondition
      the greyed label already shows. With two selected the checkbox goes
      live and there is still no sentence.
- [ ] **Open folder opens the watched folder.** Press it in the list footer
      with a folder configured: Explorer opens on that folder. This is the
      only affordance on this screen that reaches the FILES — double-click
      and both context-menu entries all act on the YouTube link.
      Then the two refusals, which report on the status strip and must NOT
      raise a dialog: with no folder set, "No recording folder is set.
      Choose one in Settings."; with the configured folder renamed or
      deleted while the app runs, "That folder is gone: &lt;path&gt;".

### Frozen build
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: the installed build renders the page at all.** The
      only proof `web/` was both bundled AND loadable. CI asserts the files
      exist at `_internal\web\`; only launching proves the window finds
      them. A blank window means the datas entry resolved to the wrong
      place — and the app will still exit 0 when you close it.
- [ ] **The frozen build loads nothing from the network.** Disconnect and
      launch. The page renders identically — fonts, icons and styles local.
- [ ] **The tray icon still draws in the frozen build.** Pillow survives
      solely for the tray. Confirm the icon is the real app icon, and that
      renaming `app.ico` falls back to the drawn placeholder rather than
      breaking startup.
- [ ] **The primary action is visually distinct.** `Upload` is the
      only brand-accent control on the screen.

## Watcher
- [ ] Recording in OBS then stopping produces one notification
- [ ] Notification does not steal focus from a fullscreen game
- [ ] Clicking the tray icon opens the uploader window
- [ ] With `notify_mode: popup`, the window raises instead
- [ ] A recording made while the app was closed is announced on next launch
- [ ] Existing recordings are NOT re-announced on an ordinary restart
- [ ] **Newly announced recordings are already checked when the window
      opens, scrolled into view, and visibly highlighted.** With the window
      closed, create a new recording so the watcher detects it, then open
      the window from the tray. Its row is pre-checked, the list is scrolled
      so the row is visible without manual scrolling (even if it would
      otherwise be below the fold), and it carries a distinct highlight
      (`ROW_PRESELECT`) visually different from the ordinary row stripes.
- [ ] **Persistent watcher failure surfaces exactly one notification.** Make
      the recording folder unreachable while the app is running (rename it,
      or unmount the drive it's on). After roughly 15 seconds, expect ONE
      tray notification that the watcher is having trouble — not one every
      poll cycle, and not silence. Restore the folder and confirm polling
      resumes normally afterward.
- [ ] **A file deleted outside the app and recreated at the same path.**
      With the app running, delete a recording in Explorer, then create a
      new file at that exact path. This is a known limitation of the
      seen-entry tracking: the recreated file may not be re-announced until
      the app restarts. That is expected behavior, not a bug to report.

## Settings
- [ ] Settings button opens the dialog
- [ ] **The dialog appears immediately, before the account state resolves.**
      Open Settings on a cold app start (the Google libraries load on first
      use). Expected: the window is drawn straight away with a grey status
      dot and "Checking…" beside it, which then becomes green "Connected"
      or red "Not connected". The dialog must never hang blank before
      appearing, and must never stay stuck on "Checking…". Flip the OS
      theme while it still reads "Checking…" and confirm the grey dot
      re-themes with everything else.
- [ ] Sign in with Google opens a browser and reports "Connected"
- [ ] **The account line names the channel once one is known.** With at
      least one completed upload, Settings must read **Connected as
      &lt;your channel&gt;**, not a bare "Connected" — the whole point is
      being able to tell WHICH account is signed in, since the app can
      otherwise upload to the wrong channel without ever saying so.
      Note it names the YouTube CHANNEL, not the Google account email:
      the app holds `youtube.upload` alone and cannot call channels.list,
      so the name is learned from an upload response.
- [ ] **Before any upload it correctly stays a bare "Connected".** Sign in
      on a profile that has never completed an upload (delete
      `channel_title` from settings.json to simulate). Expected: plain
      "Connected" with no trailing "as" and no empty gap.
- [ ] **The name appears in the session that learns it, not the next one.**
      With `channel_title` absent, sign in and complete one upload with
      Settings closed, then open Settings WITHOUT restarting. Expected:
      it already reads "Connected as &lt;channel&gt;".
- [ ] **The account button's label tracks the account state.** Not
      connected: it reads **Sign in with Google** and is clickable. While
      the lookup runs: **Checking…**, greyed. During the browser flow:
      **Waiting for browser…**, greyed, so a second press cannot start a
      second OAuth flow over the first. Once connected: **Switch account**.
      The old build showed the constant "Connect Google Account", including
      underneath the word "Connected", which said nothing about what
      pressing it would do.
- [ ] **The Discord webhook is masked by default.** Open Settings with a
      webhook already saved. Expected: the field shows bullets, not the
      URL. Tick **Show** and confirm the real value appears; close and
      reopen the dialog and confirm it is masked again. The webhook is a
      credential — anyone holding it can post to the channel.
- [ ] **Pasting into the masked webhook field still works.** Copy a webhook
      URL, paste into the masked field, confirm the line beneath resolves to
      `discord.com/api/webhooks/{id}…` (the id, never the token).
- [ ] **An invalid webhook says what is wrong.** Type `http://discord.com/api/webhooks/1/2`
      (http, not https). Expected: the line beneath reads "Webhook URL must
      use https.", not "not configured". Clear the field entirely and
      confirm it returns to "not configured".
- [ ] **Click Connect Google Account while the account state is still
      resolving.** On a cold app start, open Settings and click Connect
      immediately, while the label still reads "Checking…". Expected: the
      label goes to "Waiting for browser…" and STAYS there until the
      sign-in finishes — the startup check completing behind it must not
      flip it to a red "Not connected" mid-sign-in.
- [ ] **The YouTube Terms of Service link is visible and works.** In the
      Google account card in Settings › Uploading, confirm the line "Videos
      are uploaded to YouTube and are subject to the YouTube Terms of Service:" and the
      https://www.youtube.com/t/terms link beneath it are both fully
      visible (check at 150% display scaling too — this section grew by
      two lines), and that clicking the link opens YouTube's terms in a
      browser. Developer Policies III.A.1 requires this link to be
      displayed by the application, so it must not be clipped away.
      Then switch the Windows app mode between Light and Dark with the
      dialog open: both lines must recolour with the rest of the dialog.
      They are repainted by `_repaint_tokens`, and a label missing from
      that pass keeps its old colour — which in dark mode leaves the
      link a dark blue on a dark background, i.e. displayed but unreadable.
- [ ] **Close the Settings dialog while a Google sign-in is in flight.**
      Click Connect Google Account, then close the Settings window before
      completing (or without completing) the browser sign-in. The OAuth
      worker thread later calls back into the now-destroyed window.
      Expected: at worst a traceback printed to stderr; no crash of the
      app, no corrupted settings file, and the tray icon keeps working.
- [ ] Changing privacy and saving persists across an app restart
- [ ] Changing the recording folder takes effect without a restart —
      new recordings in the NEW folder are announced, old folder is ignored
- [ ] Switching notify mode to popup takes effect on the next recording,
      without a restart
- [ ] A non-numeric category is rejected with a warning
- [ ] **The category row does not ask for a YouTube API number.** Settings ›
      Uploading. Expected: the label reads "YouTube category", and the line
      under the row says what the number is and that 20 is the one to leave
      it on. It used to read "Category ID" with "(20 = Gaming)" beside it —
      one disclosed value out of a list this screen will not show, for an
      audience defined by wormhole multiboxing rather than by fluency in the
      YouTube Data API.
- [ ] **The webhook is still masked after a route change.** Open Settings
      with a webhook saved, tick **Show**, navigate back to the list, then
      return. Expected: masked again. A revealed credential that survives
      navigation is a leak — the mockup's cleartext webhook is exactly the
      regression this port must not reintroduce.
- [ ] **…and after a SECTION change.** Same, but instead of leaving
      Settings › Uploading, click **General** in the rail and come back to
      Uploading.
      Expected: masked again. Leaving the section fires no route change at
      all, so this is a separate path from the one above.
- [ ] **The account control tracks state through the route.** Start a
      sign-in, navigate away mid-flow, return. Expected: still reads
      **Waiting for browser…** and still disabled — `onAuthState` is the
      source of truth, not the DOM that was torn down.

### Folder dialogs

Native OS dialogs opened from the page through the bridge. Nothing
automated reaches them; the bridge tests can only assert the call was made.

- [ ] **Browse picks the recording folder.** A native picker appears, modal
      to the app window, and the chosen path lands in the field. The window
      is still draggable and responsive afterwards.
- [ ] **Browse picks the Gamelogs folder,** same expectations.
- [ ] **Cancelling a Browse changes nothing** — the field keeps its previous
      value, not blank and not the dialog's starting directory, and nothing
      is written.
- [ ] **Browse and Detect COMMIT the folder.** There is no Save button;
      picking a folder applies it. Confirm `settings.json` has the new path
      before touching anything else.
- [ ] **Typing a folder does NOT commit on blur.** Type a path into
      Recordings and click away WITHOUT pressing Enter. Expected: the text
      stays, and a line appears saying to press Enter. Nothing is written.
      This is deliberate and load-bearing: committing a half-typed path
      that happens to name a real directory rebinds the watcher, and
      `Watcher.rebind` marks every file already in that folder as seen —
      silently suppressing the announcement for every recording that
      arrived this session, then doing it again to the right folder on the
      corrective commit. It cannot be undone from the UI.
- [ ] **Enter commits it.** Press Enter in the same field. Expected: the
      message clears and the path is written.
- [ ] **Detect fills in the recording folder from OBS's own config,** and a
      second press with the field already at that path says it is already
      set rather than silently re-filling it.
- [ ] **Detect fills in the Gamelogs folder,** with the same already-set
      behaviour. With no EVE install, Detect says so rather than leaving the
      field blank with no explanation.
- [ ] **A changed recording folder rebinds the live watcher.** Change it
      (Browse, or type and press Enter) without restarting. New recordings
      in the NEW folder are announced and the old folder is ignored.
      Persisting without rebinding is the specific failure to watch for —
      it looks correct until the next recording.
- [ ] **Re-committing the SAME folder does not rebind.** Press Enter in the
      Recordings field without changing it. Expected: nothing happens.
      A rebind here would re-baseline `seen` and swallow anything recorded
      since launch that has not yet been polled.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: the first-run folder screen.** Delete
      `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FlyGD Wingman\settings.json` and launch with OBS
      absent. Expected: the window opens and shows an in-app "choose your
      recording folder" screen, from which Browse opens the native picker
      and choosing proceeds to the normal list. This is a deliberate
      behaviour change: there is no longer a bare OS dialog before any
      window exists. It CAN be left without choosing — "Set this up later"
      is deliberate, and is checked under First run — but confirm that
      leaving it that way lands on the Uploader's empty state and not on a
      blank list.

## Video list and durations
These cover the duration cache and the background probe. Do them against a
folder with a realistic number of recordings (30+); the whole point is
behavior that only shows up at size.

- [ ] **The column headers sit over their own data — with the list long
      enough to scroll.** Fill the folder with 30+ recordings so a
      scrollbar appears, then compare each header's text with the column
      under it. Expected: `Size` and `Length` right-align with their
      numbers, and `Filename` with its names, to within about 2px (that 2
      is `.list-row`'s own transparent left border, which is also what
      marks a selected row).
      **A short list is not a test of this.** The bug was the scrollbar
      narrowing the scroller while the header, which sits outside it, kept
      the full width — so with fewer rows than fill the pane it did not
      reproduce at all, which is how a previous round measured it away.
      Check both: the columns must not shift sideways as the folder grows
      past the fold either.
- [ ] **And at a wide window.** Same list, window dragged out to 1300px or
      more. Expected: still aligned. This is a different cause with the
      same symptom — the name column's cap is measured in `ch`, which
      resolves per font, so a header set in a smaller face computed a
      different maximum and parted company with its data only once the
      column got wide enough to reach that cap.
- [ ] **The Age heading and its cells appear and disappear together.**
      Sweep the window slowly across 923 CSS px in both directions.
      Expected: at 924 and above, an `Age` heading with a value under it
      in every row; at 923 and below, neither. A heading with no cells
      under it — or values under the `Size` heading — is the specific
      failure the shared grid template exists to prevent, and it has a
      standing cause: `.c-date` alone is (0,1,0) and loses to
      `.list-head > span` at (0,1,1), so a rule that hides the cell
      without qualifying through `.grid-row >` keeps the heading.
      This item replaces round 3's "there is no `Modified` column at any
      width", which the restored column makes false — and which had been
      contradicting the width item above it in the meantime.
- [ ] **Hovering an unreadable Length explains it.** Find a row showing `?`
      in the Length column and rest the pointer on that cell. Expected: a
      tooltip appears after a short delay saying ffprobe could not open the
      file and combat-log upload is unavailable for it. Hover a row showing
      `…` and confirm it reads "Measuring length…" instead — the two glyphs
      mean opposite things and both were previously unexplained.
- [ ] **A build with no ffprobe says so, and does not blame the files.**
      Run from a source checkout with no `packaging/bin/ffprobe.exe` and no
      ffprobe on PATH. Expected: every row shows `—`, NOT `?`, and hovering
      one says ffprobe was not found and that reinstalling restores
      lengths. Select a row: the summary must read `0:00+` — with the
      `+`. Both halves shipped wrong until round 2, because a probe that
      reached no verdict was rendered identically to one that read the
      file and failed: every row accused its own recording, and the
      summary stated a confident zero for a 108.8 MB file.
- [ ] **Hovering the ↗ link glyph explains both gestures.** Rest the pointer
      on a filled Link cell. Expected: a tooltip naming double-click to open
      and right-click to copy. Confirm no tooltip appears over an empty Link
      cell, over a filename, over the column headers, or over the empty
      space below the last row.
- [ ] **Tooltips follow the theme.** With a tooltip showing, confirm it uses
      the app's colours in both Light and Dark rather than a Tk-default
      yellow, and that it disappears on click and when the pointer leaves
      the list.
- [ ] **Retry is not on screen at all until something has failed.** On a
      fresh start, the panel's single card shows **Upload** and nothing
      under it but the destination line — no greyed Retry. Retry is
      enabled only after a failure in this session, which for most users is
      never. It is hidden, not greyed: there is no tooltip to hover, and
      tabbing through the panel must skip it entirely.
      (**Delete selected** is no longer beside it. It deletes files from
      disk, so it moved to the list footer beside Select all / Select none,
      where the files it acts on are.)

- [ ] **The window opens immediately on a large folder.** Launch with 30+
      recordings and no `durations.json` (delete it from
      `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FlyGD Wingman\` first). Expected: the list
      appears at once with every row present, Length reading "…", and
      the values filling in over the next few seconds. The window must be
      draggable and scrollable the whole time — never a frozen white
      rectangle.
- [ ] **A second launch is instant.** Restart the app without changing the
      folder. Expected: durations are already filled in on first paint, no
      "…" at all, and no visible ffprobe activity.
- [ ] **Changing a setting does not re-freeze the list.** With the same
      large folder, open Settings and change privacy. Expected: the list
      refreshes instantly with durations still shown; no pause. Each field
      writes only its own key now, so nothing here should trigger the
      ffprobe sweep that the whole-document save used to run on every
      Save.
- [ ] **A new recording probes alone.** Record a short clip and let the
      watcher announce it. Expected: only the new row shows "…" briefly;
      every existing row keeps its duration without re-probing.
- [ ] **Deleting recordings does not grow the cache forever.** Delete
      several recordings in the app, then check that `durations.json`
      shrinks to match what remains in the folder. This must happen on the
      delete itself, not only after some later recording is probed.
- [ ] **An unreachable recording folder must NOT wipe the cache.** With a
      warm `durations.json`, disconnect the drive the recordings live on
      (or rename the folder) and leave the app running through a few poll
      cycles, opening the window once. Expected: the list shows "Found 0
      video(s)" but `durations.json` still holds every entry. Reconnect and
      confirm the durations reappear with no re-probing.
- [ ] **Missing ffprobe degrades to "?" and stays recoverable.** Rename
      `bin\ffprobe.exe`, delete `durations.json`, and launch. Expected:
      rows show "…" then settle on "?" — never stuck on "…". Restore the
      binary, relaunch, and confirm real durations come back.
- [ ] **ffprobe removed *while the app is running* must not poison the
      cache.** With the app open, rename `bin\ffprobe.exe`, then delete a
      recording to force a refresh of a folder with new files. Expected:
      affected rows show "?". Restore the binary and relaunch: those
      recordings must show real durations again. A failure that was never
      ffprobe's verdict about the file must never be remembered — if it
      is, the row stays "?" forever and combat-log upload refuses for it
      permanently.

## Combat logs

- [ ] **No webhook configured.** Clear the Discord webhook field (or use a
      fresh install), select a recording, and press **Upload**. Expected:
      the VIDEO uploads normally and the status strip finishes on a green
      `Uploaded "<your title>" to YouTube.` and **nothing about logs at
      all**. There is NO dialog, no amber strip, and the video half is
      never blocked by the Discord half being unconfigured — that
      regression is the whole reason the two buttons could be merged.
      The silence is deliberate and `Api._post_combat_logs` says why: with
      the checkbox gone nobody *asked* for logs on this run, so reporting
      them as "skipped" would put a warning on every upload a webhook-less
      install ever performs. The fact belongs on the panel note, where it
      is true all the time.
      Configured-and-broken is the other half of that rule and does earn a
      strip — `Uploaded "…" to YouTube. Combat logs skipped: … Set it up in
      Settings.` in amber. Reaching it by hand needs a settings.json edited
      outside the app, because the field below now refuses to store a
      webhook that does not parse; `test_a_webhook_that_does_not_parse_
      still_warns` is what actually holds that branch.
      (This item used to claim the amber line for the EMPTY case and to
      name a checkbox removed by Uploader 8. Both were wrong; corrected in
      round 3's L7 while rewriting the string it quoted.)
- [ ] **An invalid webhook URL is refused.** In Settings › Uploading, paste
      a URL that is not a Discord webhook (e.g. `https://example.com/hook`,
      or `https://discord.com.evil.example/api/webhooks/1/x`) and press
      **Enter**. Expected: an INLINE message under the field naming the
      problem — not a modal dialog — and NOTHING written to
      `settings.json`. Reopen Settings and confirm the old value is still
      there. `parse_webhook` has unit tests; the wiring that calls it does
      not, so this is the only check that a refusal is honored.
- [ ] **The message is inline, and does not stack.** Type a partial URL and
      press Enter several times. Expected: one message that updates in
      place. The old path routed refusals through the modal dialog QUEUE,
      so repeated failures piled dialogs on top of each other.
- [ ] **Clearing the field does NOT wipe a configured webhook.** With a
      webhook saved, select all, Delete, then click away. Expected: nothing
      is written and the stored webhook survives — reopen and confirm. This
      is the guard that replaced the old "empty means unconfigured"
      behaviour: with no Cancel button and no pre-edit copy anywhere on the
      page, a stray edit used to destroy a credential with no way back.
- [ ] **Remove clears it.** Press **Remove** next to the field. Expected:
      the webhook is cleared and the status line says not configured.
      Removal is an explicit action now, never a side effect.
- [ ] **The webhook summary label tracks what you type.** In Settings, with
      a webhook already configured, paste a *different* valid webhook URL
      over it. Expected: the summary line underneath updates immediately to
      the new webhook's id — it must not keep describing the previous one.
      Type something invalid and it reads "not configured"; clear the field
      and it reads "not configured" too. At no point does the label show the
      token portion of the URL.
- [ ] **Gamelogs folder not found.** Rename your `Gamelogs` folder (or run
      from an account with no EVE install) with no `gamelogs_dir` set in
      Settings, then press **Upload**. Expected:
      the video uploads, and the strip finishes amber on "…combat logs
      skipped: your EVE Gamelogs folder was not found. Set it in Settings."
      No dialog. Then open Settings › Alerts and click **Detect** next to
      the Gamelogs folder with the real folder present: it fills in the
      entry. Click **Detect** again with the field already set to that path: a dialog says it's
      already set to the detected folder, rather than silently re-filling it.
- [ ] **A normal successful upload.** Select one or more recordings from a
      real fight and press **Upload**. Expected:
      the video uploads first, the strip says `Uploaded "<your title>" to
      YouTube.`, and then it steps through "Collecting combat logs…" →
      "Building archive…" → "Posting to Discord…" → a green
      `Uploaded "<your title>" to YouTube. Posted \<name\>.zip (N KB).`
      The upload line must NOT be the last thing said on its own — a user
      who reads it as the end will close the window mid-post — and the
      line that IS last still names the upload first (round 3, finding 13).
      In Discord, the message names the character(s) and file count, and
      the attached zip contains a `manifest.json` plus the `.txt` logs. The
      temp archive under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\...\tmp` is gone afterward.
- [ ] **~~Unticking the box uploads the video alone.~~ REMOVED — there is
      no box.** Uploader 8: the checkbox had no true second state ("there
      is no scenario where I don't want to upload logs also"), so logs are
      unconditional and a configured webhook is what decides the post. The
      way to get a video without logs is to have no webhook configured;
      that case is checked immediately below.
- [ ] **Selection spanning one fight in multiple clips posts ONE archive.**
      Select three clips that together cover one continuous fight. Expected:
      a single upload covering the earliest start to the latest end across
      all three — not three separate posts.
- [ ] **No readable duration (ffprobe missing/failed).** Rename
      `bin\ffprobe.exe` in the install directory, then select a recording and
      press **Upload**. Expected: the video
      uploads, then an amber "… Combat logs skipped: no readable duration for
      \<filename\>…" naming the specific recordings affected and mentioning
      ffprobe. No dialog. Restore the binary afterward.
- [ ] **Uploading before the durations finish loading.** Delete
      `durations.json`, launch against a large folder, and press **Upload**
      immediately, while rows still read "…".
      Expected: after the video, a brief pause while just the selected
      recordings are probed, then the normal log post — NOT the "no readable
      duration" skip. That message must only ever mean ffprobe actually
      failed.
- [ ] **Select All then Upload on a cold cache.** Same setup,
      but click **Select All** first. Expected: a busy cursor and a status
      line counting "Reading recording lengths… (n/N)" while it works —
      the window must explain itself rather than sitting frozen with no
      indication anything is happening.
- [ ] **A window matching no logs.** Pick a recording (or a time range) far
      from any real EVE session, or point Gamelogs at an empty folder, and
      upload. Expected: an info dialog "No EVE logs overlap that window,"
      showing the window in UTC and the folder path, and stating plainly
      that EVE timestamps are UTC. The status label reads "No combat logs
      found." No archive is left behind.
- [ ] **A failed post (e.g. a deleted webhook).** Configure a webhook, then
      delete it in Discord's channel settings without updating the app, and
      upload. Expected: an error dialog "Combat log upload failed" whose
      message explains the webhook is invalid/deleted, AND explicitly shows
      the archive's path so it can be uploaded by hand. Confirm the file at
      that path still exists after the dialog — a failed post must never
      delete the archive.
- [ ] **Settings at 100% and 150% Windows display scaling.** Open Settings
      at each scale factor and walk every rail entry — Uploading,
      Characters, Bookmarks, Previews, Alerts, General. Confirm each
      section's content is fully visible with nothing clipped, and that the
      rail itself is never pushed off the top by a long section. A previous
      release shipped with a section clipped off the bottom at high DPI,
      back when this screen was one long column; the rail is what replaced
      that column, and the pane is the only thing that scrolls. See the
      "Look and feel > Display scaling" items above for the general scaling
      checks — this item covers the rail specifically, not a duplicate of
      those.
- [ ] **The Settings rail is as tall as its entries, and the ship fills the
      rest.** Round 5's G3-rail and G2. Open Settings on Uploading,
      Characters, or General: the rail ends just below **General** rather
      than running to the status strip, and the space below and right of it
      is page wash with the ship watermark in the lower right — not a
      bordered box beside a void. Then click **Bookmarks** and
      **Previews**: those two scroll, so the watermark is **absent** on
      them by design. Scroll one of them to the bottom and confirm no part
      of the ship appears between the cards. The rail must still not scroll
      away at the top on any section.
- [ ] **One upload at a time, both halves included.** Start an upload with
      a webhook configured, and while the Discord half is still posting press
      **Upload** again. Expected: the "An upload is already in progress"
      warning. Both halves run on one worker thread, so the guard that
      always covered the video now covers the log post as well.
- [ ] **Combat-log status messages are legible in dark mode.** With Windows
      set to Dark, run an upload with logs and watch the status line through
      "Collecting combat logs…", "Building archive…", and "Posting to
      Discord…". All three must be readable. Before this refresh the first
      of them was hardcoded to black, which was invisible on a dark
      background — this item exists to catch that regressing.
- [ ] **There is no combat-log checkbox, and the fact is on the panel.**
      With a webhook configured, the panel's card holds Title, Description,
      Stitch, Upload — and, once something is selected, the selection
      summary above it — and nothing about logs.
      Clear the webhook in Settings › Uploading: a note appears under Stitch
      reading "No Discord webhook is configured, so combat logs are not
      posted." Its setup direction still names the retired Discord entry;
      the webhook is in Settings › Uploading. Put the webhook back and the
      note goes, with no restart.
      **The note is load-bearing, not decoration.** With no checkbox,
      `Api._post_combat_logs` is deliberately SILENT on a webhook-less
      install — a "combat logs skipped" strip after every upload, forever,
      is the recurring-failure pattern it exists to avoid — so the panel
      note is the only place the fact is stated. If the note is missing,
      the feature fails without saying so anywhere.
      The note tests only whether a webhook is STORED. A webhook that is
      stored but does not parse gets no note here — the confirm dialog
      reports that case, and a genuine post failure still earns its WARNING
      strip. Checked under Upload.

## Upload
- [ ] **Upload confirms before publishing anything.** Select two
      recordings and press it. Expected: a dialog naming the destination
      channel, the privacy setting, the exact title(s) that will be sent
      (including the `(1/2)` … `(2/2)` numbering), the total size and
      duration, and — when a webhook is configured — a "Logs:" line saying
      combat logs will be posted to Discord afterwards, and a closing line
      naming BOTH as un-undoable. Clear the webhook and confirm both the
      Logs line and the Discord half of the closing line disappear: this
      dialog is the only disclosure that one press publishes to two places,
      and since the checkbox went it is the webhook alone that decides.
      Choose No and confirm nothing uploads. This is the app's
      only irreversible action, and deleting local files — which are
      recoverable — already confirmed.
- [ ] **With NO webhook configured, the confirm says the logs will be
      SKIPPED.** Clear the webhook in Settings › Uploading and press Upload.
      Expected: the "Logs:" line reads "skipped — no Discord webhook is
      configured (set one in Settings)", and the closing line names
      YouTube ONLY. It must not promise a Discord post.
      This is the fresh-install state, and the dialog used to promise the
      post regardless — so every upload ended on a WARNING strip reading
      "combat logs skipped: …", which looks like a recurring failure
      rather than an unconfigured option. Also try a webhook that is
      not a valid Discord URL: the confirm parses it with the same
      function the upload half gates on, so a typo must read as skipped
      too, not as configured.
- [ ] **The confirm's five values line up.** Same dialog. Expected: the
      values after `Channel:`, `Privacy:`, `Title:`, `Total:` and `Logs:`
      all start at the SAME x, and the `(set one in Settings)` second line
      of the no-webhook branch starts there too. The separator is a tab,
      not spaces, so this is also the check that Inter actually loaded: the
      alignment rides on `tab-size` stops measured in the current font's
      space width, and under a fallback face `Channel:` crosses into the
      next stop and its value sits ~27 px right of the other four. A
      staircase here means the bundled font is missing (the failure #72
      fixed), not that the string is wrong.
- [ ] **The confirm is honest before the first upload.** With no upload ever
      completed, confirm the Channel line reads "not known yet (learned from
      this upload)" rather than being blank. The app holds only the
      `youtube.upload` scope, so it cannot look the channel up.
- [ ] **The destination line fills in after the first successful upload.**
      Complete one upload. Expected: the muted line above Upload
      changes from "Channel confirmed after the first upload" to
      "Uploads go to &lt;your channel&gt;", and still says so after
      restarting the app (it is persisted to settings.json). The privacy
      setting is deliberately NOT in this line; if it reappears there,
      format_destination has been reverted.
- [ ] **A batch's progress text names which file it is measuring.** Upload
      three recordings. Expected: "Uploading file 2 of 3… 41.2%", with the
      bar tracking the whole batch. The previous wording ("Uploading 2/3 —
      41.2%") sat beside a bar at a different value and read as a
      contradiction. A single-file upload reads "Uploading… 41.2%" with no
      file count.
- [ ] **The Title label warns about batch numbering.** Select one recording:
      the label reads "Title". Select ten: "Title (applies to all 10,
      numbered 1-10)". Tick **Stitch selected videos**: "Title (one stitched
      video)". Untick and confirm it reverts.
- [ ] **First upload triggers Google sign-in automatically, without
      Settings.** Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FlyGD Wingman\token.json`
      first, so no token is stored. Select a recording and click **Upload
      Selected** directly — do not open Settings. Expected: the browser
      opens for Google sign-in, and once you consent, the upload proceeds
      on its own. This is the automatic reauth path in the upload worker,
      separate from the **Sign in with Google** button in Settings › Uploading,
      and is likely the most common first-run route (install, see recordings,
      upload, never touch Settings).
- [ ] **The finished upload's link stays put.** Complete one upload and
      leave the window open for a minute. Expected: the row keeps its ↗ and
      its tint, and the **Open video** / **Copy link** pair stays in the
      upload panel. This is the regression to watch: `poll()` fires a
      deferred `refresh()` the moment an upload finishes, and `refresh()`
      used to clear `self.links` — so the link appeared and then vanished a
      moment later. Trigger an extra rebuild by recording something new,
      and confirm the link still survives.
- [ ] **The finished upload's link survives a RESTART.** After the above,
      quit from the tray and start the app again. Expected: that row still
      carries its ↗, double-click still opens the video, and right-click →
      Copy link still gives the same URL. Round 5's link-state: the link
      used to live only in `RowSnapshot._links`, so the column was empty on
      every launch and the question it exists to answer — *did I already
      upload this fight?* — was unanswerable in the normal case.
      `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FlyGD Wingman\links.json` is the store; deleting
      it must cost the links and nothing else, so try that too and confirm
      the list still renders with an empty Link column.
- [ ] **A re-recording at the same filename shows NO link — in the same
      session AND after a restart.** Upload a recording, then make OBS write
      a new file over that same name (or copy a different recording onto
      it). Expected: the Link cell is **empty**, not the old video, without
      restarting; then restart and confirm it is still empty. The store is
      keyed on `(size, mtime)` rather than the path precisely so this cannot
      serve the previous fight's link — the one failure here sends the user
      to the wrong video, which is why it is worth reproducing by hand.
      **Both halves, because they have different mechanisms and the
      same-session one nearly shipped broken:** across a restart the store
      is the only source, but within a session `RowSnapshot._links` is keyed
      by PATH and survives the rebuild, so the row would inherit the old
      link unless the refresh actively clears it.
- [ ] **Open video opens the uploaded video**, and **Copy link** puts the
      same URL on the clipboard with "Link copied to clipboard" in the
      status line.
- [ ] **The pair is hidden before anything has uploaded.** On a fresh start
      with no uploads this session, confirm no Open/Copy buttons are shown
      rather than two dead ones.
- [ ] **The pair points at the newest upload.** Upload two recordings
      separately and confirm Open video opens the second.
- [ ] **Deleting the recording behind the link removes the pair.** Upload a
      recording, then Delete Selected on that same row. Expected: the
      buttons disappear rather than offering to open a row that is gone.
- [ ] **Single upload completes and the link column fills in with ↗**
- [ ] **Copy link via the row's right-click context menu puts a working URL
      on the clipboard.** Right-click a row with a completed upload, choose
      "Copy link", paste elsewhere to confirm. Confirm "Copy link" is greyed
      out on a row with no link yet.
- [ ] **Open in browser via the context menu opens the video's YouTube
      page** — not the local video file. Confirm it is greyed out on a row
      with no link yet.

### Uploader — Play, Rename, and Post the last hour

Nothing in the suite renders this page, and two of these three write to
the user's own files, so this section is the verification rather than a
report of it.

- [ ] **The row menu reads Play, Rename…, separator, Copy link, Open in
      browser.** The first two act on the recording on disk, the last two
      on the video it became; the rule between them is what says so.
- [ ] **Play opens the recording in the default player.** Not the YouTube
      page — that is what double-click and Open in browser do, and both
      must still behave exactly as they did.
- [ ] **Play is live on a row with no link.** It acts on the file, so it
      has nothing to do with whether the recording was uploaded.
- [ ] **Play on a recording deleted behind the app's back** (delete it in
      Explorer without refreshing) reports it on the status strip and
      names the file. No dialog.
- [ ] **Play on a recording OBS is still writing** opens and plays. Then
      confirm the known consequence: while the player holds the file, that
      recording's announcement is deferred — `watcher.file_is_closed`
      reads the player's handle as "still being written" — so a
      not-yet-announced recording appears in the list a poll or two later
      than it otherwise would. Expected, not a bug.
- [ ] **Rename… prefills the STEM only, with no extension**, and the
      renamed file keeps its original extension. Type `fight.mp4` and
      confirm you get `fight.mp4.mkv` rather than a file claiming to be an
      MP4.
- [ ] **Rename to a CASE-ONLY variant.** `fight.mkv` → `Fight.mkv`. This
      is the rename a user is most likely to want, and it was the one this
      list originally called unverifiable. It is no longer: CI runs the
      whole suite on `windows-latest` as well as ubuntu, so
      `test_a_case_only_rename_is_not_a_collision` exercises `Path.rename`
      against a real NTFS volume and passes. What is left for a human is
      confirming it end to end in the app — the prompt, the repaint, the
      row text — not discovering whether the filesystem allows it. If it
      fails HERE while CI is green, the difference is Wingman's own code
      path rather than NTFS.
- [ ] **Rename to a name already in the folder is refused, and the file it
      would have replaced is untouched.** Check its size and timestamp
      afterwards. A silent overwrite here destroys a fight.
- [ ] **Rename keeps the selection, the focus ring and the sort order.**
      Tick three rows, sort by Size, right-click a fourth and rename it.
      Expected: the three stay ticked, the ring stays where it was, the
      sort does not reset, and only the renamed row's text changes.
- [ ] **Rename keeps the ↗.** Upload a recording, rename it, and confirm
      the Link column still carries its arrow and still opens the right
      video. Then restart the app and confirm it survived — that is the
      persisted store, and nothing can rebuild it.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: a renamed recording is not announced again.** Rename
      one, then leave the app running for two or three watcher polls
      (~10s). Expected: no toast, and the row does not arrive ticked as a
      newly finished recording. This is the failure that would otherwise
      surface days later and read as a bug about OBS.
- [ ] **Rename is refused while an upload is running**, including a
      STITCHED upload of that very recording — the case where Windows
      would otherwise allow it, because the open handle is on the merged
      temporary rather than on the source.
- [ ] **Rename refusals re-open the prompt with the typed text still in
      it.** Try `CON`, a name ending in a dot, and one containing `:`.
      Each gets its own sentence, and none costs the whole name.
- [ ] **Post the last hour posts to Discord with no video involved.** No
      selection, no upload, no Google account touched. The archive lands
      in the channel and the strip names it.
- [ ] **The button goes inert while the post runs and comes back
      afterwards** — including when the post fails.
- [ ] **With no webhook configured**, the note in the Combat logs card is
      showing AND the button is still live; clicking it reports the reason
      on the strip. Then configure a webhook in Settings › Uploading,
      return to the Uploader **without restarting**, and confirm the
      button posts. (The note itself will still be showing — see the known
      issue below; the button must not be dead.)
- [ ] **Post the last hour while an upload is running is refused**, and
      the sentence is about the upload rather than about combat logs.
      Then the reverse: start a post, click Upload while it runs, and
      confirm that refusal says combat logs are being posted rather than
      "An upload is already in progress".
- [ ] **An hour with no logs in it** reports "No combat logs found." on
      its own — with no sentence about an upload in front of it, because
      no upload happened.
- [ ] **The panel at the window floor.** Resize to the minimum (840×625)
      and confirm the Upload button is fully visible without scrolling,
      with the Combat logs card below it. Repeat at 200% display scaling,
      where the panel is 248px wide. The second card may need a scroll;
      Upload may not.
- [ ] **Double-clicking a row with a completed upload opens its YouTube
      link**, same destination as the context menu, and leaves the row's
      tick state unchanged. Double-clicking a row with no link does
      nothing at all — it must not leave the row ticked either.
- [ ] Multi-select without stitch uploads each with `(1/n)` titles
- [ ] Each row gets its own correct link
- [ ] Stitch of two videos produces one upload, both rows show the same link
- [ ] Stitch finishes in seconds (stream copy, no re-encode) and the
      uploaded video plays through the join with audio in sync
- [ ] No `stitch-*` leftovers (video or concat list) in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\...\tmp`
- [ ] Killing the network mid-upload shows "retrying in Ns", then resumes
- [ ] After exhausting retries, the Retry button APPEARS beside Delete
      selected, which gives up its full width to make room
- [ ] Retry resumes rather than restarting from 0%
- [ ] Retry of a 3-file batch that failed on file 2 uploads files 2 and 3,
      and fills in links for both
- [ ] Retry of a failed STITCHED upload re-stitches and restarts (expected —
      the temp file is deleted on failure by design)
- [ ] No `stitch-*` leftovers (video or concat list) even after a failed upload
- [ ] **Non-retryable upload failure disables Retry.** Trigger a hard API
      error rather than a network blip — either exhaust the shared daily
      quota, or revoke the app's access from your Google account's
      permissions page and then upload. Expected: a plain-language error
      dialog (not a traceback or stack trace), and the Retry button stays
      ABSENT, since retrying cannot help. This is a distinct code path
      from the "kill the network" case above — confirm Retry's state
      differs between the two.

- [ ] **Stopping an upload says how much of it landed.** Start a batch of
      three or four recordings and press **Cancel** while the second or
      third is going up. Expected: the strip reads
      `Stopped. 2 of 4 uploaded.` in amber, the bar stays where it got to
      rather than resetting to 0, and **Retry does not appear** — a stop is
      not a failure. Then check YouTube: the recordings that finished are
      still there, and their rows still carry their `↗`. This is the whole
      point of the wording. A message implying nothing happened would be
      the opposite of what is true on the channel, and there is nothing
      else on screen that says otherwise.
      The stop is noticed at a 4 MiB chunk boundary, so on a fast link a
      small file can finish before the cancel lands — use large recordings
      or a throttled connection, and expect a beat between the click and
      the strip changing.
- [ ] **Cancel appears only while the upload is actually going, and takes
      Retry's place.** Watch the slot beside **Upload** through a whole
      job. Expected: at rest, `Retry` (disabled) and no Cancel; during the
      upload, `Cancel` and no Retry; when it ends — successfully, by
      failure, or by being stopped — Cancel is gone again. The two are
      never on screen together.
- [ ] **Cancel is NOT offered while a stitch is running.** Select two or
      more recordings, tick **Stitch**, and press Upload. Expected: while
      the strip reads `Stitching with FFmpeg…` there is no Cancel; it
      appears only once the join is done and the upload of the merged file
      begins. ffmpeg has no interruption seam here, and a Cancel that did
      nothing for the minutes a join takes would be worse than none.
- [ ] **A finished upload stops looking like an armed one.** Upload a
      single recording and watch the PANEL, not the strip. Expected: the
      selection clears, the summary **disappears** (round 5's U4: with
      nothing selected it said "Nothing selected" directly above a greyed
      Upload, stating one fact twice in two treatments), and **Upload goes
      inert**. Before round 3 the post-success screen was
      near-identical to the pre-upload one — same `1 selected · … · …`
      above a live, saturated button — and the only evidence of success
      was a 14px grey arrow in the narrowest column. A stopped job must
      NOT do this: the selection stays, because which files went and which
      did not is exactly what matters then.

## Delete
- [ ] **`Delete selected` is visibly destructive only while available.**
      Look at the four footer buttons together with a recording selected.
      Expected: `Delete selected` carries the red outline and label
      (`.btn.danger`), and the other three do not. Clear the selection:
      expected, its disabled border and label become neutral like the other
      unavailable controls, with the same dimming and no hover response.
      It used to be pixel-identical to `Select all` beside it when enabled,
      then stayed strongly red when disabled. Profiles' enabled `Delete` is
      the destructive reference; the two must match.
- [ ] **It still confirms exactly once.** The treatment is appearance only.
      Expected: one confirmation, naming every file, from Python's own
      dialog — not two, and not the page's `WM.confirm`.
- [ ] Confirmation dialog lists the correct filenames
- [ ] Cancelling deletes nothing
- [ ] Confirming removes the files and refreshes the list
- [ ] A deleted file is not re-announced by the watcher

## Single instance
- [ ] Launching a second copy exits quietly with no second tray icon
- [ ] The first instance keeps working normally afterwards
- [ ] **Tray Quit actually exits.** Right-click the tray icon and choose
      Quit. Expected: the process ends, the tray icon disappears (no
      orphaned icon lingering until Explorer refreshes it away), and no
      background process remains running.

## Dialogs and confirmations

Modal dialogs were native `messagebox` calls and are now in-page modals fed
by `onDialog`, with `confirm` answered by `dialog_response(id, ok)` — the one
request/response pair in an otherwise fire-and-forget protocol. A dropped
response leaves a worker waiting forever, which presents as a hung upload.

- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: Upload confirms before publishing anything.**
      Select two recordings and press it. Expected: a modal naming the
      destination channel, the privacy setting, the exact title(s) including
      `(1/2)` … `(2/2)` numbering, the total size and duration, and the
      "Logs:" line while the combat-log box is ticked. Choose No: nothing
      uploads, NOTHING is posted to Discord, and the app is not left busy.
      Then repeat and choose Yes. This modal now guards two public actions,
      not one.
- [ ] **The confirm is honest before the first upload.** With no upload ever
      completed, the Channel line reads "not known yet (learned from this
      upload)" rather than being blank.
- [ ] **The delete confirmation lists the correct filenames,** warns it
      cannot be undone, Cancel deletes nothing, Confirm removes and
      refreshes. It opens with focus on Cancel. Tab and Shift+Tab stay inside
      the dialog; Enter activates whichever button has focus; Escape cancels;
      closing returns focus to Delete selected when it is available, or to
      the first enabled control on the same route while a worker keeps the
      invoking action disabled.
- [ ] **The no-selection and busy warnings are distinct messages.** Press
      Upload and Delete selected each with nothing selected, and read both.
      Then start an upload and press the other mid-flight. These are
      several specific messages, not one generic guard.
- [ ] **Escape and the scrim answer a confirm as "no", never as nothing.**
      Both cancel cleanly and the app is immediately usable — no upload, no
      stuck busy state, and Upload works on the next press. Clicking inside
      the dialog does not dismiss it; only a primary-button press and release
      both on the scrim do. Drag-select body text past the dialog edge to prove
      that gesture does not cancel or discard a prompt value.
- [ ] **A dialog raised from a worker thread reaches the page.** Kill the
      network mid-upload and let the retries exhaust. The error modal
      appears with plain-language text, not a traceback, and the window is
      responsive behind it.

## Progress

- [ ] **No progress control is drawn at rest.** Round 5's G1. On a fresh
      launch the strip reads **Idle** with nothing to its right — no groove,
      no percentage. The bar appears when an upload or stitch starts and
      goes again when the strip clears. Then the error case, and **it must
      be a STITCH failure, not an upload one**: exhausted retries raise
      `UploadFailed`, which pushes no progress at all and leaves the bar
      frozen at its last percentage, so killing the network tests nothing
      here. Tick **Stitch** on two recordings and make ffmpeg fail (point
      `ffmpeg_bin` at a missing binary, or remove a source mid-join).
      That reaches the one push this item is about, and the red line must
      not be followed by an empty groove sitting at 0%.
- [ ] **Cancel before the first chunk leaves no empty bar.** The second
      state that reaches the same rule. Start an upload and press **Cancel**
      immediately, before any percentage appears: the strip says nothing was
      uploaded and draws no bar. Cancel *after* a percentage has shown and
      the bar must instead stay where it was — the ground the job covered is
      kept, and only zero ground means no bar.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: the progress bar is indeterminate during a stitch.**
      Select two, tick Stitch, upload. While ffmpeg runs the bar animates
      continuously with NO percentage — stitching reports no progress and a
      bar sitting at 0% reads as a hang — and switches to a real percentage
      the moment the upload begins. Stitch twice in one session and confirm
      it switches back correctly.
- [ ] **Progress renders during a real upload.** Upload three recordings.
      "Uploading file 2 of 3… 41.2%" with the bar tracking the whole batch,
      updating smoothly rather than jumping only at file boundaries.
- [ ] **The window stays responsive throughout.** Mid-upload, drag the
      window, scroll the list, sort a column and open the context menu. A UI
      that stalls means work is running on the wrong thread.
- [ ] **The retry countdown is visible.** Kill the network mid-upload:
      "retrying in Ns" counting down, then a resume — not a frozen bar. When
      the retries are exhausted, Retry appears.
- [ ] **Status severity colours are distinguishable.** Force a red error, a
      green success and an ordinary status in one session. All three legible
      against the near-black ground and clearly different.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: a finished job does not follow you around.** Round 3's
      finding 14: a green `Posted combatlogs-….zip (15 KB).` and a bar at
      100% were still on screen in a capture of a *different folder with
      zero recordings*, and again on Profiles and Skills. Complete one
      upload, then click Skills, Profiles and the gear. The strip must read
      **Idle** with no progress bar drawn at all and no percentage on each,
      and stay Idle
      when you come back. It clears on leaving the route, so the completion
      is still there while you are looking at the folder it was about.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: a job still running is never cleared.** The opposite
      case, and the reason this is not just "clear on every route change".
      Mid-upload, click Skills and back: the percentage and the bar are
      exactly where they were, still counting. Then the harder one —
      **during a stitch**, which reports no progress at all and can go
      minutes between pushes, so a cleared strip would leave the app looking
      idle with nothing due to repaint it. Switch route mid-stitch: the bar
      must still be animating and the text must still say
      `Stitching with FFmpeg…`.
- [ ] **A successful upload is announced as one.** Round 3's finding 13: the
      strip used to end on `Posted combatlogs-….zip (15 KB).` — the words
      *uploaded*, the title and *YouTube* appeared nowhere on the app's one
      irreversible action. Upload one recording with a webhook configured:
      the last line reads `Uploaded "<your title>" to YouTube. Posted
      combatlogs-….zip (…).` Upload two without stitching: `Uploaded 2
      recordings to YouTube.` — no title, because build_body numbers them
      and there is no single name to give. With Stitch on, two recordings
      are one video and the title comes back.
- [ ] **A skipped log half still says the upload worked.** Point Gamelogs at
      nothing and upload: `Uploaded "…" to YouTube. Combat logs skipped: …`
      in amber, no dialog. The sentence must open with the upload.

## Release
- [ ] **`uv.lock` carries the new version.** It records this project's own
      version alongside its dependencies, and CI's version-consistency check
      covers only `pyproject.toml`, `__init__.py` and `installer.iss` — so a
      bump that misses the lockfile passes CI and ships a lock claiming the
      previous version. Run `uv lock` after bumping the three, confirm the
      `wingman` entry matches, and commit it with the bump.
      (It was last observed stale at `2.0.0` against `2.1.0`.)
- [ ] **Version-consistency check catches a mismatch.** Bump one of
      `pyproject.toml`, `wingman/__init__.py`, or
      `packaging/installer.iss`'s `AppVersion` (but not the other two),
      push, and confirm CI's "Check version consistency" step fails and
      names all three versions, including the mismatched one.
- [ ] **The app icon appears on the Start Menu shortcut and in Add/Remove
      Programs.** Run the built installer, then check the Start Menu entry's
      icon and `Settings > Apps > Installed apps`. Both should show the real
      icon rather than a generic exe icon, since `installer.iss`'s
      `UninstallDisplayIcon` reads the icon embedded by `uploader.spec`.

## The Settings rail

Bookmarks and Previews stopped being top-level destinations and became
sections here. Nothing in pytest executes the page, so the wiring below is
only ever checked by hand.

- [ ] **Settings opens on Uploading, not General.** Press the gear from any
      destination. Expected: the Uploading pane is showing and Uploading is
      the highlighted rail entry, on the FIRST open of a session.
      General's whole content is one checkbox for turning the EVE half off;
      it is a legitimate control and a poor first impression of the app's
      configuration surface. This is also the fact `WM.current_section`
      declares in app.js — the two disagreed, silently, and
      tests/test_page_conventions.py now holds them in step. If the pane
      and the highlight ever disagree with each other, that test has been
      bypassed rather than the markup being wrong.
- [ ] **Six rail entries, General last** — Uploading, Characters,
      Bookmarks, Previews, Alerts, General — and clicking each shows its
      content with exactly one entry highlighted. The old Account, Uploads,
      Folders and Discord entries were consolidated under Uploading; the
      Gamelog folder card now lives in Alerts. The Google account, Recording
      folder and Combat log webhook cards must be in Uploading, and
      `When a recording finishes` still sits in that section. Check it is
      there and that picking an option still sticks across a restart.
      General is last because its only content is the switch that hides the
      EVE-gated tail of the rail: untick it and Characters, Bookmarks,
      Previews and Alerts disappear together, without opening a hole in the
      middle. If that count is wrong, trust the rail and fix this line.
- [ ] **Rail selection and keyboard focus are different states.** Click
      Previews, then press Tab until another rail entry receives focus.
      Expected: Previews keeps the filled current-location treatment while
      the focused entry has an outline only. The focused neighbour must not
      look like a second selected section. Tab to **Manage groups** too and
      confirm its summary receives the same visible focus outline.
- [ ] **No card heading repeats the rail entry you just clicked.** Walk the
      rail and read the first heading in each pane. Folders and Discord both
      repeated themselves ("Folders" / "Folders", "Discord" / "Discord
      (combat logs)"), which DESIGN.md forbids in as many words and which
      spends the one line that could say what the card does. Expected now:
      "Google account", "Recording folder" and "Combat log webhook" in
      Uploading, and "Gamelog alerts" and "Gamelog folder" in Alerts.
      tests/test_settings_page.py holds this mechanically; what it cannot
      judge is whether the replacements read well at the window
      floor, where they wrap.
- [ ] **Bookmarks and Previews render their real data**, not empty shells:
      the keybind rows, the EVE window list, the per-character preview
      keybinds. Both used to load on entering their own route; they load on
      entering their SECTION now, and a mis-wired listener shows an empty
      pane with no error anywhere. That silence is the failure mode: a
      handler that throws mid-module takes every registration below it with
      it, and the route loads as an inert copy of itself.
- [ ] **An armed capture is purple-ringed, and its label is not purple.**
      Click a keybind button so it reads "Press a key…". Expected: a purple
      border and a lifted background, with the label in ordinary white
      text. The label used to be `--brand-text` too, which measures 4.16:1
      on that background and 3.99:1 with the pointer on it — both under
      4.5:1, on the one control in the app that is asking to be read.
      Pick a row with **no clash warning** first, then repeat on a
      **clashing** one — D7 gave the two states separate channels, so that
      row is expected to show the **purple** border with the label still in
      the clash **red**. Before D7 it took the clash red for both and the
      armed state was invisible, which is why this step used to say to
      avoid such a row.
- [ ] **A disabled control looks disabled and stays inert under the
      pointer.** Hover each control the page switches off: `Upload` with
      nothing selected, `Show` / `Remove` with no webhook configured,
      `Continue` on first run before a folder is chosen. Expected: dimmed
      to .45, no background lift, and the plain arrow cursor rather than
      the hand.
      Round 3's L5 moved four control classes onto one declaration; all
      three sites above are `.btn`, so this is a regression check on the
      one class that already had a treatment. In Previews, opt a character
      out and hover its disabled keybind and Clear / Edit actions too.
      Before L5 `.linkbtn` and `.bindbtn` had no disabled rule, so dead
      controls still lit up.
- [ ] **Enabled subordinate actions read as live before hover.** Compare an
      enabled Preview Clear / Edit action and Skills Rename / Delete action
      with a disabled one. Expected: enabled labels are quiet but clearly
      legible; disabled labels remain distinctly dimmer. Hover still lifts
      only the enabled action. They remain link-style subordinate actions,
      not neutral or accent buttons.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: an armed keybind capture is disarmed by leaving the
      section.** Go to Settings > Bookmarks, click a keybind button so it
      reads "Press a key…", then WITHOUT pressing a key click **Uploading** in
      the rail. Now type into the Folder field in the Recording folder card.
      Expected: your text appears normally.
      If it is swallowed, the capture is still armed: its handler
      preventDefault()s EVERY key including Tab, and stopPropagation() does
      not stop previews.js's sibling listener on the same node. An escaped
      capture eats what you type and persists it as a keybind, off-screen.
      This used to be covered by leaving the ROUTE; switching sections
      fires no route change, which is why `wm:section` exists.
- [ ] **Same check leaving Settings entirely.** Arm a capture in Bookmarks,
      then click **Uploader** in the title bar. Return to Bookmarks: no
      capture is armed.
- [ ] **The gear returns you to where you were.** From Skills, open the
      gear, then press it again. Expected: back on Skills, not the
      Uploader.
- [ ] **Bookmarks is two cards, and the eighteen binds read as three
      groups.** Open Settings > Bookmarks. Expected: `EVE-FOCUSED KEYBINDS`
      first, holding `Register keybinds in EVE` and every bind; `EVE
      WINDOWS` second. There is no `BOOKMARK KEYBINDS` card any more
      (round 5's C7 — it was a titled card around one checkbox, and the
      third name for one idea in a single viewport).
      Then read the binds: four full-width rows, then `FINISHERS` over a
      two-column block of ten reading `HS (highsec)` … `C6`, then `TAGS`
      over four reading `e (end of life)` … `c (critical)`. The shared
      token belongs to the heading now, so no row should still say
      "Finisher:" or "Tag". If the whole list renders flat and unheaded,
      the payload lost its `groups` key — which is the designed fallback,
      not a crash, so nothing will be in the console.
- [ ] **A bookmark overridden by a Previews keybind says so.** Bind a
      Previews chord (Settings > Previews) and the same chord to a bookmark
      action. Expected on Bookmarks: that bind button is marked — red while
      previews are ON, dim while they are off — with a tooltip naming which
      set wins. Round 5's C6: this warning existed only on Previews, the
      screen that WINS the collision, so on the screen whose bind silently
      stops firing an overridden bind looked identical to a working one.
      Check the wording is stated ONCE too (C5): the full precedence rule
      belongs under Previews > Global keybinds, and Bookmarks carries only
      a pointer to it.
- [ ] **The EVE window list marks only what is not running.** Settings >
      Bookmarks > EVE WINDOWS with at least one client open. Expected:
      running clients carry no annotation at all and the card's own hint
      says "All of these are running unless marked otherwise"; a title that
      is enabled but whose client is closed reads `(not running)`.
      Round 3's R4 finding 5 annotated BOTH states, so thirteen clients
      printed "(running)" thirteen times; round 5's C9 keeps what R4 was
      protecting — silence has to be defined, not inferred — and defines it
      once in the hint instead.
- [ ] **The card has three spacing tiers, and the dividers rank below the
      heading.** Settings > Previews. Expected: a hint sits noticeably
      closer to the control it explains (4px) than one setting sits to the
      next (10px), with the `.bind-group` hairline wider again between
      groups. Every gap on this card was 10px, which is why nine settings
      and twelve paragraphs read as one wall. Also check `APPEARANCE`,
      `PLACEMENT`, `SIZE AND SHAPE` and `WHEN YOU SWITCH AWAY` are not
      BRIGHTER than `EVE CLIENT PREVIEWS` above them: they were
      `--text-dim` under a heading at `--text-label`, so every divider
      out-ranked the card title and the card read as five peer bands.
      Rank is size only now. Check the master switch block has not gained
      spacing: it spaces itself with flex `gap` so its height cannot move
      with the state of the switch inside it, and the first draft of the
      4px rule out-specified that and put 14px gaps in it.
      Check the tier lands on a RENDERED hint only: most status slots are
      blank on a healthy install and collapse to nothing, and the first
      draft of this rule keyed on markup rather than on what renders, so
      `Show the character name on each preview` sat 4px above `Opacity` --
      the "inside a control" tier between two unrelated settings. Bookmarks
      and Alerts had the same inversion at their first control, so check
      all three sections rather than Previews alone.
- [ ] **`How previews behave` is a disclosure, and it is the only prose
      that moved.** Settings > Previews, under the master switch. Expected:
      a closed summary, opening to the click/right-drag/resize gestures.
      The line between kinds is deliberate — a sentence stating a COST or
      a non-obvious behaviour stays resting text (`Applies the next time a
      client is switched away from`, `one raised while you are away is
      still waiting`), and only prose that TEACHES the product is behind a
      click, because only that kind stops being news. Nothing was deleted
      except `Positions are remembered per character`, which
      `Reopen previews where you last put them` already says beside the
      switch that governs it.
- [ ] **Saved geometry stays inside Configure.** Settings > Previews,
      open **Configure** for a character that has never been previewed but
      has another character to copy from. Expected: `Size…` is replaced by
      an em dash with a hover explanation, and `Copy…` remains alongside it
      in the detail. No collapsed-row Geometry cell remains.
- [ ] **Two controls stop claiming a width they have no use for.**
      Settings > Previews. Expected: `Default preview size` is a short
      field (~12 characters), not a 586px box holding `480x300` — which
      read as an empty field and was the second thing on this card that
      looked broken without being broken. The opacity readout sits just
      after its slider rather than parked at the far card edge ~556px from
      its label.
- [ ] **Opacity is a percentage, and it still reaches the floor.**
      Settings > Previews. Expected: the dark track and bordered thumb fit
      the other controls, the adjacent value reads `100%`, not `255`, and
      dragging fully left reads `8%` rather than `20`. Tab to the slider:
      the thumb receives the shared visible focus ring. While dragging, the
      value follows live; the preview and settings file update only when the
      change commits on release. Round 5's C2: the control was showing a raw
      Win32 alpha byte, so its floor read "20" and every reader takes that
      for 20% when it is 7.8%. The stored value is still the 0-255 byte; at
      40% the settings file must hold 102. If the readout is EMPTY, the
      module threw before its listeners registered; that is exactly the
      inert-screen failure this file's preamble describes, and it happened
      once while this lane was being written.
- [ ] **The Never-minimize disclosure exists only while its toggle is on.**
      Settings > Previews with `Minimize a client's window while it is not
      the one you switched to` UNTICKED — the shipped default. Expected:
      no `Never minimize` block renders under it at all — not a `<details>`
      full of disabled checkboxes, no block, full stop. Tick the toggle: a
      collapsed disclosure appears directly beneath it, live, without a
      reload; untick it and the whole thing is gone again, live. Round 5's
      C3 counted ~13 permanently disabled Never-minimize checkboxes in the
      old default state; D6's rule — the setting stays per-character but
      must not render where it can do nothing — now governs the block's
      own existence rather than one cell in every row.
      Open the disclosure and tick a name in its roster: the summary above
      it changes immediately, without a reload, the same as the Lock block
      below it. **Tick the NEXT name with the keyboard** — Tab to it and
      press Space. The box you just ticked must still have focus (its
      focus ring is still on it, and the following Tab reaches the name
      after it, not the top of the page). Repainting the whole block here
      rebuilds every checkbox including the one being clicked; Chromium
      then moves focus to `<body>`, so ticking thirteen names by keyboard
      meant thirteen restarts from the top of the page. The summary
      repaints on its own now, and the roster is left standing.
      **An opted-out character stays live here. The Lock block also stays
      live if that character has an enabled saved crop.** Untick `Preview`
      on a character: their primary preview stops and its keybind controls
      go dim. Then open this
      disclosure: their box is still tickable there and still takes
      effect, because Never minimize still governs a client with no
      preview (see "`Preview` turns one character's preview off" below).
      **The alignment hazard this used to test still exists, just not on
      this toggle.** `#preview-binds` is still a grid whose rows are
      `display: contents`, so the CSS track count and the number of cells
      previews.js appends for each row still have to move together — if
      they disagree by one, every row after the first is pulled into the
      previous row's leftover columns. Nothing in this table toggles that
      cell count any more; watch for it whenever a row's own cells vary
      instead — an unset bind, an absent `Clear`, an absent `Size…`.
- [ ] **A roster checkbox announces the character, and the block says
      what the tick means.** Settings > Previews, either disclosure open,
      with a screen reader (or the accessibility pane of any Chromium
      inspector pointed at the real window). Expected on one of the
      roster boxes: the accessible name is the character's name and
      nothing else — not "Lock <name>", not "<name> <name>" — and the
      group it sits in is named by the disclosure's own summary sentence,
      which is what supplies "locked" or "never minimized". The row's own
      `Preview` box is the opposite case and must keep its `aria-label`:
      that label has no visible text at all. Restating the purpose on
      every roster box would override the visible name, which is the
      failure WCAG 2.5.3 names.

**Character crops (Windows/WebView2 release gates remain open)**

Headless Chrome can exercise the `?dev=1` controls below, but is not evidence
for native WebView2 focus, Windows DPI, picker behavior or DWM resources.
The current [production evidence and release blockers](preview-crops-production-results.md)
keep the cap of eight provisional. No native item below is closed by the
Linux/browser or synthetic/message-only Windows test runs.
Schedule the native pass with Task 10 before release; do not launch EVE or
Wingman automatically as part of the browser pass.

- [ ] **Crop lives inside Configure.** At 840x625 and the 839x625 rounding
      case, open a character's Configure detail. Crop is beside Cycle group
      and Saved geometry, not a new grid column or destination. Labels align;
      controls and status wrap without horizontal scrolling. Long names
      ellipsize in the roster and remain readable in the Remove confirmation.
- [ ] **Select, disable, reselect, remove.** With previews enabled and the
      source available, `Select region…` opens the native picker after keybind
      capture disarms. Commit a drawn region with `Use region`, then reselect
      with `Use full` and verify the secondary mirrors the entire client.
      The wrapped Enabled checkbox, neutral `Reselect…`, and destructive Remove
      appear. Disable retains selection/position; Remove confirms their loss
      and distinguishes itself from Disable. Escape cancels without a write.
      Use Tab/Space and verify visible focus throughout, including the native
      picker return.
- [ ] **Saved settings outlive runtime availability.** Offline/master-off:
      Enabled and Remove stay usable, while region selection explains the
      unavailable source. Test disabled, cap-suppressed, invalid-source,
      degraded, and stopping states. Counts use the delivered cap. Disable
      and Remove must remain ways out of a full cap or degraded crop.
- [ ] **Crop-only owners do not inherit primary locks.** Untick primary
      Preview for a character with an enabled saved crop. The Lock checkbox is
      inert because there is no primary preview to lock. Whenever the secondary
      is live it remains movable and resizable; offline, master-off, and
      cap-suppressed definitions remain editable. A saved owner absent from all
      other rosters still has a
      row. In `?dev=1`, also exercise `constructor`, `__proto__`, and `toString`.
- [ ] **Asynchronous saves tell the truth.** Pending shows Selecting/Saving,
      not a refusal, and preserves a requested checkbox value until terminal
      authority arrives. Failed saves restore committed definitions and show
      the error. Test terminal-event-before-receipt, late older receipts,
      stale root delivery, successful no-op, and reentry after missed or
      expired operation history. No write occurs before hydration. Leaving
      invalidates focus restoration, not an admitted save. Keep an unsent
      group name or armed keybind while crop state changes; neither is lost.
- [ ] **Native smoke, separately on Windows.** Repeat Configure keyboard
      paths in pinned WebView2 at 100/125/150/200% scaling. Exercise picker
      cancel/use-region/use-full/resize/source loss, master-off during
      admission, independent crop positioning and lock independence. Task 10's
      DWM/HWND resource, cap,
      stop-tail, client-window-safety and performance gates must also pass.
      No headless screenshot closes these gates.
- [ ] **Production stages and temporary slot.** Follow the predeclared thresholds
      in the production results document at stages 1/2/4/8 against matching
      primary-only baselines. Record the exact tested commit, clients, hardware,
      monitor rectangles/scales and source resolutions. Keep every intended
      crop visible. At stage eight also test picker, replacement, cancellation,
      initial DWM failure and save failure with the same memory allowance.
      Count thumbnail registrations/unregistrations separately from HWNDs:
      the picker has an additional overlay and native child controls, not
      additional DWM relationships. Picker and candidate must never overlap;
      peak relationships are primary baseline plus at most nine, and every
      relationship/top-level/owned/child HWND returns to baseline on teardown.
- [ ] **Persistence and lifecycle on real Windows.** Exercise restart restoration,
      master-off, primary exclusion, close-to-disable save failure, source
      exit/logout/return, hidden-at-birth, degraded recovery, capture theft and
      stop during an admitted save. Reselection must not save an untouched
      monitor rescue or lose real movement. Test tall/flat initial selections,
      saved partial overhangs, source/picker resizing and negative coordinates.
      Never move or resize a real EVE client to automate a scenario.
- [ ] **Record minimized-source behavior rather than assuming it.** With explicit
      operator approval, compare minimize/restore and occlusion, including a
      primary alert pulse while dragging a crop. Record whether minimized
      content is live/frozen/black/stale and whether it recovers without a retry
      storm. This remains unmeasured; update help only after observation.
- [ ] **Release decision.** Do not ship without the Windows frozen-build and
      production native gates. If eight fails, lower the cap to a fully tested
      passing stage and repeat the temporary-slot test. If only the extra slot
      fails, implement/test the approved free-slot reselection fallback. If
      one crop fails, block release. Missing evidence is not a passing stage.

Dev drivers: `DEV.previewCrops('offline')`, `'crop-only'`, `'cap-full'`,
`'pending'`, `'failed-save'`, `'degraded'`, `'invalid-source'`, `'stopping'`,
`'master-off'`, `'event-before-receipt'`, or `'no-op'`.
`DEV.finishPreviewCrop()` completes the held pending operation. These are
browser fixtures only, not native behavior or release evidence.

- [ ] **The columns are named once, above the rows.** Settings > Previews,
      at the character list. Expected: a single heading row reading
      `Character`, `Preview`, `Keybind`, `Configure` — sentence case, a step
      smaller and dimmer than the names below it — with one blank heading
      over the cell `Clear` and `Edit…` share. `Lock` and `Never minimize`
      name nothing here any more: both left the row for their own
      disclosures under the toggles they except, so the three CHECKBOX
      columns this heading row used to carry are down to one, `Preview`,
      still a bare box with no word beside it. `Size…` and `Copy…` appear
      only after opening Configure, where they remain verbs on controls,
      not collapsed-row columns. `Clear` and
      `Edit…` have no heading for the same reason, and `Clear` is now
      ABSENT — not present and disabled — on a row with no chord to
      clear, sharing its cell with `Edit…`, right-aligned so `Edit…` sits
      at one edge of the cell whether or not `Clear` is beside it. Check
      each heading sits at the left edge of the column it names.
      Lock and Never minimize's own per-row labels were retired from this
      table once already (round 5: 39 label instances on a
      thirteen-character roster, 26 of them in the shipped default state
      where the Never-minimize column did not render). This lane retired
      the columns those labels lived in outright, so there is no longer a
      `Lock` or `Never minimize` word anywhere in this row at all.
- [ ] **The Lock summary resolves all four states of the polarity table.**
      Settings > Previews, the Lock block beneath `Lock previews in place
      by default`. Reach each state by flipping the default toggle and
      ticking names in the disclosure's roster (by keyboard for at least
      one of them, and the ticked box must keep its focus ring — same
      check, same reason, as the Never-minimize disclosure above), and
      check the summary reads exactly:
      - default OFF, no exceptions ticked — a door, `Lock individual
        characters`.
      - default OFF, some ticked — `Locked: ` and their names.
      - default ON, none ticked — `Locked: every character`.
      - default ON, some ticked — `Locked: every character except ` and
        their names.
      The door is the one state that must NOT reappear once the default
      is on with no exceptions: it is keyed on the RESOLVED state being
      nobody locked, not on the exception list being empty, and with the
      default on and nothing ticked every character is already locked —
      a door offering to lock one there would offer something already
      done. Past halfway, the summary names the UNLOCKED minority instead
      of the locked majority ("every character except…"), so also check
      that crossover with seven or more characters in the roster.
- [ ] **The minimize toggle is filed with the other window behaviour.** It
      is in `EVE CLIENT PREVIEWS`, next to `Reopen previews where you last
      put them` — not under `GLOBAL KEYBINDS`, where it was the one control
      that is not a keybind (round 5's C4).
- [ ] **`Preview` turns one character's preview off, and only that one.**
      Two clients running, previews on, both mirrored. UNtick `Preview` on
      the first character's row — the box is ticked at rest now, and
      ticked means this character gets a preview. Expected, with no
      reload: that preview disappears within a sweep (~700ms), the other
      one is untouched, and the rest of that row — the bind button,
      `Clear` and `Edit…` — goes dim and stops responding to clicks.
      Configure stays live for saved groups and crops; its primary Saved
      geometry actions alone are inert. The row's saved keybind stays
      legible on the inert button; it is not cleared. `Lock` and `Never minimize` are not in this row
      any more; check them in their own disclosures instead:
      **the character's box in the Lock block must read inert**. Secondary
      previews never inherit the primary lock and remain movable and resizable.
      **Their box in the Never-minimize block must STAY LIVE**. Opting out
      of previews stops the primary preview, not `minimize_inactive_clients` — switching away from
      that character's real EVE window still minimizes it — so greying
      its only control would leave a setting in force with no way to
      change it.
      Then press that character's own focus keybind: nothing happens, and
      the chord reaches EVE instead. Press cycle forward repeatedly: the
      walk visits every other running character and never stops on this
      one. (Starting that walk *from* the off character's own client is
      the one exception: it restarts at the first name rather than
      continuing from where you are, the same as cycling from a browser.)
      Its alert sounds still play, with nothing on screen to flash — that
      is deliberate, and Settings › Alerts is where to turn them off.
      Re-tick `Preview`: the preview comes back at the position and size
      it had before, the row's controls go live, and the focus keybind
      works again. Nothing about the row should need re-entering — the
      settings were kept, not cleared.
      **The stored key is still `preview.excluded`, an opt-out roster.**
      Only the control was inverted. Check settings.json after unticking:
      the character's name is ADDED to `excluded`. If the inversion ever
      reaches Python, a file written by this build and read by an older
      one silently shows every preview the wrong way round.
- [ ] **An unticked `Preview` character stops competing for chords on
      OTHER rows.** Give a character the same chord as `All forward`.
      Expected first: the cycle row goes red and says the cycle keybind is
      the one that loses. Now untick `Preview` on that character. Expected:
      that warning clears, because Python has dropped the character and
      the cycle keybind now genuinely wins the chord — press it and it
      cycles. The cycle row is live and undimmed throughout, so a stale
      warning there is fully readable and states the opposite of what
      happens.
- [ ] **`Size…` is absent for a character that has never been dragged.**
      Settings > Previews with at least one character offline that has
      never had its preview moved or resized. Open that row's **Configure**
      detail. Expected: it shows no `Size…`; if another character has saved
      geometry, `Copy…` is available beside the explanatory dash. Now drag
      that character's preview once and reopen Configure: `Size…` is there.
      Running clients always have it. The point is that
      `set_preview_size` refuses a character with no layouts entry, and a
      layouts entry is written on a drag or resize rather than merely on
      discovery.
- [ ] **Copy geometry offers only usable sources.** Give at least three
      characters saved layouts, leave one online and one offline, open the
      target's **Configure** detail, then open `Copy…`. Expected: the app-owned picker groups
      sources under visible `Online` and `Offline` labels, excludes the
      target, and offers no character without a full saved rectangle. The
      selector owns initial focus, Tab stays inside the picker, Escape cancels,
      and focus returns to the target's `Copy…` action.
- [ ] **Copy changes only size and position.** Copy onto an open target:
      its preview moves immediately through the normal monitor clamp. Copy
      onto an offline target and launch it: it uses the copied rectangle.
      In both cases compare settings before and after; keybind, effective
      lock, preview exclusion, never-minimize, and every other character
      preference are unchanged. A copied rectangle from a disconnected
      monitor is rescued onto an attached display without rewriting the
      source character.
- [ ] **Copy handles empty and stale state.** With no row that has another
      character's saved layout available, no dead Copy control renders and
      one hint explains how to create a source. One saved layout is enough
      for Copy on every other roster target, so verify that state too. Open a picker, remove/reset its source before
      committing, then choose it: the refusal names that the placement is no
      longer available, the rows refresh, and focus returns to the same target
      by character name or to the first safe control if that row disappeared.
- [ ] **Manual keybind entry remains the layout escape hatch.** After using
      and cancelling Copy, click `Edit…`, type a valid virtual-key spelling,
      save it, then arm ordinary key capture. Both paths still work, and
      leaving Previews disarms capture as before.
- [ ] **The row still fits at the window's floor.** Settings > Previews at
      the smallest the window will go (840x625). Expected: every row ends
      inside the card after the trailing `Configure` or `Edit…` control,
      nothing is clipped, and the Settings pane has no horizontal scrollbar.
      Grid tracks do not wrap, so an overflow here is a cut-off control at
      every width, not a reflow. Open Configure on
      several rows and confirm its full-grid detail returns the same way:
      Size and Copy must never widen or add a collapsed roster column.
- [ ] **The two global defaults are reachable and take effect.** Settings >
      Previews, below `Keep previews the same shape as their client`.
      - `Default preview size` shows the current pair and commits on
        **Enter, never on blur**. Type a size, click elsewhere without
        pressing Enter: nothing is saved and the field snaps back. Half a
        typed `1280x720` is `1280x72`, which is a real size a blur commit
        would have stored. Type something that is not a size: the hint
        says so and nothing is written. Type `10x10`: refused with the
        same floor sentence `Size…` uses.
        Then set a size and start a client that has never been previewed:
        its preview opens at that size, **without restarting Wingman**.
        These two keys were read once at host construction until this
        change, so a restart-to-apply bug here would look exactly like
        the field working.
      - `Apply to open previews` (beside the field) **is on screen before
        you touch anything** — check this first, it is the whole of the
        bug. Its row holds an empty label, the button, and a status slot
        that only fills in once the button has been used, which is exactly
        the shape `.settings .row:has(> .lab:empty)…` collapses to
        `display: none`. It shipped invisible until clicked, i.e. never.
        A lexical guard now pins the collapse selector against controls,
        but the guard cannot see a render: if the button is missing here,
        the selector has been widened again.
        It resizes every open
        preview to the pair the field holds, **including previews with a
        custom size** — that is the point: it is the "make them all this
        size" action, and honouring per-character exceptions would make
        it silently skip windows the user sized once and forgot. After
        applying, `Size…` on one card still overrides that one window.
        Refused with a sentence while previews are stopped. Check the
        sizes survive a restart: the apply records layouts like a drag,
        unlike Reset.
      - `Selection ring colour` is **five named swatches, not a colour
        input**: no white 50x26 UA box, and clicking one must not open the
        Win32 ChooseColor dialog. Hover reads `Teal (#00c8dc)` and so on;
        the checked one wears a halo in the page's own colours. There is
        deliberately no red — alerts own that hue, and a steady red ring
        beside a red combat pulse is the one confusion here that costs
        something. A `settings.json` hand-edited to an off-palette hex
        shows a SIXTH swatch labelled with its hex rather than being
        silently rewritten (the `?dev=1` harness ships `#ff5a00`, so the
        harness shows six by design).
        It recolours the ring on the preview you
        last clicked, live, on every open preview at once — no restart,
        no re-click. Reload Settings: the chosen swatch is still checked.
      - The button grammar, with `Lock previews in place` off:
        a plain left click switches; a left drag moves; a right drag
        resizes that preview; left+right held together and dragged resizes
        EVERY open preview at once, each keeping its own position. Check
        the click switch survived the drag move: a left press that
        wanders a few pixels and releases still switches, and a left
        drag does NOT switch. A locked left drag neither moves nor
        switches.
      - `Lock previews in place by default` locks every character whose
        own box in the Lock disclosure directly beneath it you have not
        changed. Tick it with one character already explicitly unlocked:
        that character stays draggable and every other preview stops
        moving on a right drag — which is now the only move gesture, so a
        locked preview cannot be moved by mouse at all until it is
        unlocked. Right-click the locked primary: an existing secondary
        toggles off, then on, while a character with no configured secondary
        is unchanged. Verify it is movable and resizable before the toggle off
        and again after it returns.
        Untick it without touching anything else: the arrangement that
        preceded the tick comes back. Nothing is migrated and the roster
        is not rewritten — `preview.locked` keeps meaning "these differ
        from the default".
        **Then check the case where that is NOT an undo**, because the
        obvious reading of a default says it should be. Start with the
        default off and an empty roster, tick it, unlock one character
        while it is on, then untick it: that character is now the only
        LOCKED one. The roster was not rewritten — the box you changed
        meant the opposite thing on each side of the flip. This is the
        semantics, not a bug; the item exists so nobody "fixes" it.
        Check the disclosure's own checkboxes repaint to the effective
        state the moment you toggle the default — a stale copy shows the
        exact inverse of every row rather than merely lagging. Check
        already-open previews change behaviour without a restart.

## EVE bookmark hotkeys

Requires a Windows machine with EVE running. None of this is covered by
pytest — the engine is AutoHotkey.

- [ ] **The title bar holds exactly four destinations** — Uploader,
      Profiles, Skills, Fittings — and the window still drags by the
      wordmark area. Bookmarks and Previews are NOT here: they are
      sections of Settings, reached through the gear. This item was
      written when there were two destinations and went unchecked while
      three more were added; the fifth pushed the bar past its width at
      125% scaling. NOTE: that recorded reason does not survive the floor
      correction — at 840 CSS px the arithmetic says it should have fit.
      `DESIGN.md` carries it as an open question, now with a headless
      (non-Windows) CSS measurement at 840/839 CSS px alongside it — see
      the item below, and do not treat that measurement as covering this
      one. The four-destination rule itself rests on `PRODUCT.md`'s
      destination-vs-configuration test and is unaffected.
- [ ] **UNVERIFIED — reproduce `DESIGN.md`'s headless 840/839 CSS check on
      real Windows/WebView2, at every display scaling.** `DESIGN.md`'s
      "Fourth destination, measured" note records titlebar client width,
      `document.scrollWidth == clientWidth`, the drag region's width and
      edges, the nav's left/right edges, and every window control's
      (gear/minimize/close) left/right edge — all confirmed in headless
      Chromium against `wingman/web/index.html?dev=1` at CSS viewports
      840x625 and 839x621, `deviceScaleFactor: 1`, with every edge inside
      the titlebar's own client width and all four destination labels
      visible. That is NOT a Windows/WebView2 result: it cannot exercise
      the DPI rounding that makes an 840 logical minimum measure as 839
      CSS px at 200% in the first place (`ui/window.py`'s `MinimumSize` /
      `ptMinTrackSize`), which is exactly the fact this checklist's other
      display-scaling items exist to check. Restart at 100%, 125%, 150%
      and 200%, drag the window to its floor, and check the same values
      by hand (or via a real WebView2 CDP session) at each. This item
      stays unchecked until that has actually been done — do not check it
      off on the strength of the headless numbers above.
- [ ] **The bar survives its own minimum at 150% scaling.** Set Windows
      display scaling to 150%, restart, drag the window to its floor. The
      four nav labels, the gear, minimize and close are ALL visible, and
      the wordmark area still drags. Nothing in the bar shrinks: the nav
      and the window buttons are flex:none and the drag region cannot go
      below the wordmark's own width, so an overflow here clips the close
      button off the right edge rather than compressing anything.
- [ ] With the feature off, the status bar shows no EVE segment
- [ ] Enabling starts the engine; the status bar segment appears
- [ ] Hotkeys fire in an enabled EVE window and do nothing in an unenabled one
- [ ] **All nineteen binds do nothing when a non-EVE window is focused.**
      Registration happens inside a function called while an `IfWinActive`
      criterion is active; if that criterion does not carry into the
      function, they register globally and fire everywhere. Nothing in the
      repository can test this; confirm it by hand.
- [ ] **Set Root does nothing outside an EVE window.** It is registered
      inside the per-window loop like everything else, and that registration
      is now the *only* thing scoping it — `DoSemi`'s own `IsEveWindow`
      re-check was dropped to track the helper author's script exactly. The
      one gap that guard covered is still real and cannot be tested from
      the repository: between un-ticking a window and the ~10s refresh that
      tears its binds down, a press in that window resets the root state.
      Confirm the normal case by hand; the gap is accepted.
- [ ] **THE ONE THIS RELEASE IS ABOUT — Set Root resumes numbering for home
      holes.** Make several home bookmarks whose first field is a single
      character plus a sig, e.g. `1-ABC`, `2-DEF`, `A-GHI`. Select all of
      them and press Set Root.
      Expected: root reads **Home/Zero**, and the next values are **3** and
      **B** — it resumes past the used slots.
      The bug: root read `1` and the next values were `11` / `1A`, because
      the parser mistook the single character for the root. `ZeroMode` was
      dead code in the script the port was made from; the re-vendored
      engine wires it up.
- [ ] **Grab Sig no longer uppercases what it captured.** The fork ran
      `StringUpper` over the three characters; the author's script does not,
      and the re-vendor follows the author. Finisher-generated names are
      unaffected (`FireRootFinisher` uppercases the whole result), so this
      shows only in the status bar's sig readout and in what Grab Sig puts
      on the clipboard for you to paste by hand. EVE displays signature IDs
      uppercase already, so in practice there should be nothing to see —
      check the sig readout looks right, and say so if it does not.
- [ ] **A Grab Sig that copies nothing says so.** Focus something with no
      selectable text — an empty area of the probe scanner, or a window with
      nothing selected — and press the Grab Sig bind.
      Expected: a tooltip reading "Grab Sig failed - nothing was copied",
      and the sig readout **unchanged** from before.
      The bug: the sig silently became the first three characters of
      whatever was already on the clipboard. Straight after a Set Root that
      is the root, so root `J214811` produced sig `-J21`, and the next
      finisher wrote it into a real bookmark with nothing flagging it.
      Then confirm the normal path still works — select a scanner row,
      Grab Sig, and check the readout shows that row's signature.
- [ ] **Correcting a finisher with the OTHER family does not eat a slot.**
      Root `1`, Grab Sig, C1 finisher, then HS. Expected: next num `11`,
      next alpha `1B` — the superseded C1 slot is released because the
      pasted key replaced the bookmark outright (`1-XXX 1` became
      `1A-XXX H`), and only the H key's slot is consumed. The bug: next
      num read `12`, the C1 slot still marked used with no 1-key bookmark
      on anything. Same-family corrections keep their existing meaning:
      C1 then C1 again consumes exactly one slot, as do HS then LS.
- [ ] **Set Root on an ENTIRE bookmark list fills gaps.** This is the
      "Entire bookmark list" row of `docs/bookmarks_reference.md`. Select
      the whole list of a scanned system — **including the system's own
      return bookmark**, the one whose prefix is the bare root — and press
      Set Root. With `1-ABC`, `12-GHI`, `13-MNO` (11 expired), expected:
      root `1`, next `11` — it refills the gap rather than continuing at 14.
      Including the return bookmark is what makes this work: DoSemi takes
      the first parseable line's prefix as the root, and EVE's alphabetical
      sort puts `1-ABC` ahead of `11-DEF` because "-" sorts before digits.
      Select only the numbered bookmarks and the root comes out `11` with
      no gap filling — that is the author's design, not a defect.
- [ ] **Set Root on a SINGLE bookmark starts fresh numbering.** The "Single
      bookmark" row of the reference. Select `1-ABC` alone: root `1`, next
      `11` / `1A`, and the root on the clipboard.
- [ ] **Set Root with NOTHING selected gives Home/Zero and touches nothing.**
      The "Nothing" row: fresh numbering at 1/A, and nothing moved to the
      clipboard.
- [ ] **The two keybind cards say which keybinds they are.** Settings >
      Bookmarks heads its card "EVE-focused keybinds"; Settings > Previews
      heads its card "Global keybinds". Each names the other set and where
      it lives. Both were headed "Keybinds", one rail item apart, for two
      systems that take each other's keys — bind the same combination in
      both and confirm the Previews row marks the collision.
- [ ] **There is no Copy or Paste row in the keybinds card**, and no key
      Wingman registers sends a bare `^c` or `^v`
- [ ] **Rebinding a window-scoped hotkey stops the old key firing** — the
      direct test of the teardown repair, and the bug that shipped for years
- [ ] Disabling a window stops its hotkeys firing, within ~10s
- [ ] Every finisher produces the correct Flygd/ABH name (Protean removal)
- [ ] **Tags are written lowercase: `e`, `/`, `f`, `c`.** The class
      finishers (`H`/`L`/`N`/`13`/`C1`-`C6`) are a different code path and
      stay uppercase
- [ ] **CapsLock lowercases the class finishers ONLY outside root mode.**
      New with the re-vendor: `DoY`/`DoP`/`DoDot` pick `h`/`l`/`n` when
      CapsLock is on. In root mode — the default state, and where you will
      be for every other item here — `FireRootFinisher` runs
      `StringUpper` over the whole result before pasting, so you will see
      `H`/`L`/`N` regardless. Seeing uppercase in root mode is correct, not
      a failure. The lowercase path is reachable only after a Set Root that
      found nothing parseable.
- [ ] **There is no medium-hole tag** — no `M` row in the keybinds card, and no key
      writes an ` M`
- [ ] **The frig tag writes `f`, not `S`.** Same bind and INI key (`FinS`),
      so an existing binding for it still works
- [ ] **Re-tagging a bookmark that already carries a legacy ` S` replaces
      it with ` f`** rather than leaving both on the line
- [ ] **There is no Bookmark naming card in the section** — home holes, the
      return-bookmark toggle and the preface field are all gone
- [ ] **The generated INI has no `[Settings]` section at all.** Open
      `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FlyGD Wingman\eve_bookmark_helper.ini`: it should
      contain `[Keybinds]` and `[Enabled]` and nothing else. The engine has
      no naming settings left to read, so writing them would be config that
      nothing consumes.
- [ ] **Home bookmarks start at `.1`** — now a property of the engine
      itself rather than of a value Wingman writes
- [ ] **Return bookmarks are NOT prefaced** — no `!`. There is no preface
      anywhere any more: not in the UI, not in settings.json, not in the
      INI, and not in the engine
- [ ] **There is no Root card in the section.** Root mode, the Set root box
      and the Clear button are gone. The status bar's ROOT / NEXT readouts
      are the only root display, and they still update as you use the
      hotkeys — check they do.
- [ ] **THE SILENT-NO-OP TRAP: enabled with nothing to register says so.**
      Tick Enable but leave every EVE window unticked. Expected: a line under
      the engine state reading "No hotkeys are registered — no EVE window is
      enabled below." Then tick a window but clear every keybind: the line
      reads "…no keybinds are set." With both wrong, it names both.
      Untick Enable and the line disappears entirely.
      The bug: `RegisterBind` ignores a blank key without recording a
      failure, and the per-window loop never runs with nothing ticked, so
      `failed_binds` stayed empty and the UI reported **Running** with no
      warning while every keypress did nothing — indistinguishable from the
      feature being broken. This is what a fresh install looks like before
      you configure it, so it is the first thing a new user would hit.
- [ ] Deliberately binding two actions to one key shows the collision warning
- [ ] Binding a key another application owns shows a registration failure,
      not a silently dead key
- [ ] **Importing a REAL `eve_bookmark_helper.ini` reproduces that setup.**
      AutoHotkey writes it as UTF-16 LE; reading it as UTF-8 parsed nothing
      and saved that nothing over the user's settings while reporting
      success. Use a file written by the standalone script, not one retyped
      in an editor — retyping it changes the encoding and hides the bug.
- [ ] Importing a file that is not a helper INI refuses and leaves the
      existing keybinds untouched
- [ ] Importing a config with `Mode=1` says Protean naming is not supported;
      one with `Mode=2` says nothing about it
- [ ] **Reset to defaults** replaces all 18 binds after confirmation,
      and the confirmation says 18 — bookmarks.py's BIND_IDS is the
      count, and three places used to disagree with it
- [ ] **Refresh** on the EVE windows card picks up a client launched while
      the section was already open
- [ ] Config changes apply within 10s without losing root or used slots
- [ ] No console window flashes when the engine starts
- [ ] Killing Wingman via Task Manager leaves the engine running; restarting
      Wingman terminates it
- [ ] With the pid file pointing at an unrelated live process, starting
      Wingman does **not** kill it
- [ ] **A hung engine is reclaimed at startup even with the feature turned
      off.** Reclamation runs unconditionally, not from the enable path;
      otherwise disabling the feature stranded a live keyboard hook.
- [ ] **Enabling with the interpreter deleted shows the reason**, not a bare
      "Stopped" — and the reason survives the next poll tick a second later
      rather than being overwritten by it
- [ ] ~~**At 125% and 150% Windows display scaling the EVE status segment
      hides** rather than crowding the progress bar.~~ **Not performable —
      do not check this.** It rested on the window's floor being 840
      physical pixels and the viewport therefore being 672px or 560px. The
      floor is 840 CSS px at every scaling, so `@media (max-width: 720px)
      { .evestat { display: none; } }` cannot fire through the window and
      the segment never hides. Nobody had observed it; it was reasoning
      only, from the wrong premise. What the strip does when it genuinely
      runs out of room — the EVE segment yields, upload progress does not
      — is still the recorded intent
- [ ] `AutoHotkey-COPYING.txt` and `ffmpeg-COPYING.txt` are installed beside
      the application as **files**, not as directories containing a licence

## Remote Fleet Bar (Task 9b, production shared mode still disabled)

Use `fleetbar.html?dev=1` in a fresh owned browser profile and an isolated
loopback server, not an existing authenticated browser. `DEV.fleetBar(kind)`
provides local, remote, mixed, stale, empty, hidden, long, max, maxlocal, defensive,
zero, nolog and roster fixtures. The dev-only branch supplies its creation fragment
before the real page captures it; do not bypass production token admission.
This exercises the actual standalone handler, not `app.js` or a second fake API.

- [ ] At the actual 420px shell, verify full REMOTE / REMOTE · STALE meaning,
      wrapping within the identity column rather than overlapping Damage. Check
      subdued stale outgoing DPS/tackle, full long-name hover titles, readable
      10000000 in both local Damage halves and truthful LOCAL health alongside
      remote-only rows. Remote IN is an unavailable dash with no fill or warning,
      never zero or NO LOG; local NO LOG occupies one Damage cell. Check zero,
      independent OUT/IN scales and defensive >10m separately.
- [ ] Scroll the long roster to its final row with mouse and keyboard. Column
      headers stay aligned with data; only the header drags the widget. The
      inset focus ring remains visible and focus survives live repaint. Check
      fit, saved placement and monitor clamping on Wingman's own window.
- [ ] With the real worker and synthetic relay, stop successful reads and local
      telemetry: remote rows still stale at three seconds and expire at ten.
      Repeated same-publication observations, Off/On and source clear never
      rejuvenate old metrics. Empty successful reads withdraw immediately.
- [ ] A hidden, quiet or NO LOG verified local suppresses its matching remote;
      another remote remains. Unverified same-name characters remain separate.
      No remote enters the local visibility list, seen settings or publication.
- [ ] Fleet Bar Off hides display without changing sharing; shutdown detaches
      remote/catalogue subscribers before bounded joins. No late row returns.
- [ ] Repeat on installed Windows/WebView2, including native 420×90 startup and
      real DPI/monitor behavior. Chrome evidence is not native acceptance.
      Live two-client HTTPS/server proof belongs to Task 10; no production mode
      enablement, OAuth or EVE interaction is authorized by this checklist.

## Fleet sharing setup and source controls

The setup card lives in Settings > Previews, beside Fleet combat bar and outside
its Preview master-switch block. Use an isolated fixture relay/account for these
checks; no production pairing, OAuth, or real EVE-window manipulation is needed
for the synthetic render pass.

- [ ] A clean/Off startup reads connection metadata once without creating a key,
      changing the preference, publishing telemetry, or opening a browser.
- [ ] Enter/leave Previews and hide/reopen the Wingman window. Source watching
      follows visibility; closing never sends Stop. Source controls work with
      sharing, previews and Fleet Bar Off and without a local telemetry runtime.
- [ ] Connect/upgrade opens only this explicit action's saved approval URL,
      once. Restart, hydration, expiry, and generic 401 recovery open no browser.
      Fresh setup asks about new-key/old-pending-intent consequences and is
      admitted only after worker proof or an explicit configured-origin change.
- [ ] Use an owned boss with missing Fleet Read. The browser goes only to the
      paired origin's `/auth/eve/fleet-read?character=<owned-id>`. A different
      browser account asks for the correct account, never replacement keys.
      Grant completion alone neither Starts verification nor enables sharing.
- [ ] **Unavailable setup must finish reading without enabling actions.** In an
      isolated browser use `?dev=1&sharing-watch=missing-worker`, then `null` and
      `error-no-state`, and open Settings > Previews. Expect “Fleet sharing is
      unavailable in this session.”, disabled sharing/setup controls, and no
      promise that Refresh rebuilds the worker. Leave and re-enter; no consent,
      Start or browser action may run. Separately verify the missing-worker
      path in Windows/WebView2; browser fixtures are not native acceptance.
- [ ] Check empty, 256-character, unavailable, feature-disabled, paused, revoked,
      ended and unknown-source states. Eligible IDs are distinct from the boss
      selector. Unknown pending UUIDs remain stoppable; one source's response
      never acknowledges another. An expired unobserved Start names its UUID.
      A capacity-refused Start (`DEV.fleetSharing('rejected')` in the isolated
      harness) says “Start not saved”, not expired or saved; its UUID remains
      visible and its Stop is disabled. Existing pending sources stay stoppable.
- [ ] Tab/Space/Enter operate checkbox, boss selector, Start and keyed Stop.
      Watch refresh preserves selector selection and Stop focus. A queued On
      leaves Off reachable even while preference saving is held. A failed save
      leaves the actual session choice visible with a restart-risk warning.
- [ ] Sharing On reconciles local telemetry without restarting Wingman. Restart
      recovers pending Off/Stop with the same IDs even while the preference is
      Off. Quit closes delivery/watch, detaches subscribers, then bounded-stops
      sharing before telemetry; a still-stopping worker is not replaced.
- [ ] Hiding EVE tools refuses while sharing, pending actions, live sources or
      unknown bound source state need controls. Enabling EVE tools stays usable.
- [ ] **Real installed-window scaling remains required:** repeat at the actual
      840×625 / 839×621 CSS floors on Windows at 100/125/150/200%, without CSS
      zoom. The Task 8 artifact records Chrome plus an isolated pywebview 6.2.1
      DEV-page run at current DPR 2 and both viewport sizes. That is not proof
      of the installed frameless window's resize/DPI behavior or other scalings.
- [ ] Real DPAPI, frozen packaging, live pairing/OAuth and multi-device relay
      acceptance require their separately authorized release smoke pass.

## EVE client previews

Requires a Windows machine with at least two EVE clients running. None of
this is covered by pytest: the window, the pump, and DWM compositing all
need a real desktop.

Enable previews in Settings before starting.

- [ ] Two clients running gives two previews, each showing live video, not
      a frozen frame. A still image means the thumbnail registered but the
      source is minimised or occluded — check the log for
      `DwmRegisterThumbnail failed`.
- [ ] Each preview's label shows the character name, in Inter — not a
      blocky bitmap face. A bitmap face means the bundled font did not
      load; the log says so explicitly.
- [ ] **The name is an overlay, not a band.** With `Show the character
      name` on, the pill rides the top-left corner OVER the video and the
      picture runs the full interior — with labels off, toggle the
      setting and confirm the video does not move or resize by a single
      pixel (this is the aspect fix: the old band shrank the picture 30px
      and bent the locked aspect). Click and drag THROUGH the pill: it
      must be click-through, so every mouse gesture reaches the preview
      beneath. Drag and resize the preview and confirm the pill follows
      and never detaches or overlaps beyond the frame. A client with an
      armed alert: the pill shifts inward with the ring, and toggling
      labels off mid-alert removes it while the ring keeps pulsing.
      **First, the obvious check: the pill is actually visible.** (Its
      window is created hidden and shown explicitly; the one release
      where the show call was missing rendered perfect pills onto a
      window that was never mapped, and the feature looked simply dead.)
      Also check hide-on-lost-focus takes the pill with the preview, and
      that quitting Wingman with labels on leaves no orphan pill behind.
- [ ] Clicking a preview brings that client to the foreground. If Windows
      refuses the switch, the log has `Activation of 0x… did not take` at INFO.
- [ ] **The ring marks the client you last used, and stays there.** With
      two clients running, switch to one: its preview gains the cyan ring
      and the other loses it. Now click a browser, Discord, or Wingman's
      own window while that EVE client is still up. Expected: **the ring
      does not move and does not go out** — it is answering "which client
      are you flying", not "which window has the foreground". It moves
      only when the *other* client is switched to, and clears only when
      the ringed client exits. (It used to clear the moment focus left
      EVE; that was reported as unexpected and is what
      `PreviewHost._selected_key` being sticky fixes.)
- [ ] Dragging a preview moves it. Dragging near another preview or a
      screen edge snaps it flush.
- [ ] Dragging the bottom-right corner resizes it, and the video follows
      the frame rather than staying its old size or spilling past the
      border.
- [ ] Dragging a preview smaller and smaller floors it instead of
      inverting. An inverted rect makes the video vanish silently.
- [ ] Restart Wingman: previews return to their saved positions and sizes.
- [ ] **Same-session character selection keeps placement without keeping
      identity.** Put Character A's preview somewhere unmistakable, then log
      A out to character selection without closing that EVE client. Expected:
      the generic preview remains at A's current rectangle, but its label is
      generic and A is offline in Settings; A's character hotkey and alerts do
      not target it. Log Character B into the same client. B moves to B's own
      saved rectangle, or the normal default if B has none. Repeat rapidly and
      with several clients, confirming only the transitioning preview moves.
      With restore positions OFF, A-to-selection still keeps the current
      rectangle, while B uses the default as that setting requires. An opted-
      out A must not produce a generic preview at character selection.
- [ ] **Cold-start character selection has no invented identity.** Close and
      restart Wingman while an EVE client is already at character selection.
      Expected: it uses the normal generic/default placement. No character is
      inferred or added to `preview.seen` or `preview.layouts`.
- [ ] Close one EVE client. Its preview disappears within ~1s; the others
      keep rendering and do not flicker or jump.
- [ ] Close every EVE client. No previews remain, nothing crashes, and
      Wingman still responds.
- [ ] Start a client again with Wingman still running: a preview appears
      for it, at its saved position if that character had one.
- [ ] Log in a character that has never been previewed while others are
      already placed: it gets a free slot rather than landing on top of an
      existing preview.
- [ ] **Monitors whose tops do not line up** (e.g. a 4K panel spanning
      y 0..2160 beside a 1440p one starting at y 291): a never-previewed
      character gets a preview that is **on a display**, not in the gap
      above the shorter monitor. This found a real bug — the virtual
      desktop is the bounding RECTANGLE of all monitors, not their union,
      so the space above a shorter monitor is inside it and on no screen.
      A preview deposited there is invisible AND un-draggable, so it can
      never acquire the saved position that would rescue it: every new
      character would be lost permanently. Passes on a single monitor, and
      on any arrangement with aligned tops, whether or not the code is
      correct — so it has to be checked on staggered monitors specifically.
- [ ] Unplug a monitor that holds a saved preview position, then restart
      Wingman. That preview comes back **on a remaining display**, not at
      its saved coordinates in empty space. Same clamp as the item above,
      reached by the other route. Also unplug during an A-to-character-
      selection transition: the carried rectangle is rescued through this
      same clamp rather than being stranded on the removed monitor.
- [ ] Disable previews in Settings. Every preview vanishes and the
      `wingman-preview` thread exits — check Task Manager shows no extra
      thread and the log has no "did not exit within" warning.
- [ ] Re-enable: previews come back, still in their saved positions.
- [ ] Quit Wingman with previews enabled. The process fully exits — it
      must not linger in Task Manager after leaving the tray.
- [ ] **Two monitors at different scale factors** (e.g. 100% and 200%):
      previews land where dropped on both, at the right size, and dragging
      one across the boundary does not halve or double it. This is the
      thread-local DPI work; it is the item most likely to fail and the
      hardest to notice on a single-monitor machine.
- [ ] Check the log for one line reporting the DPI override result, and no
      repeated warnings during an idle minute — the 700ms sweep must be
      silent when nothing changes.

      The DPI line is `logger.debug`, so it is invisible at the default
      level. Start with `WINGMAN_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to see it:

          Preview thread DPI override accepted: True

      Expect exactly one, at thread start. That variable also reveals the
      other preview diagnostics that INFO discards — whether `WM_HOTKEY`
      reached the host window, why a placement read failed, and the
      registration push that is swallowed at launch because previews start
      before the webview exists. Anything in this file that says "check
      the log" for a preview-thread detail needs it.

      From WSL, environment variables do not reach a Windows process
      unless exported: `WSLENV=WINGMAN_LOG_LEVEL WINGMAN_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`.
      Without `WSLENV` the app starts normally and logs nothing extra,
      which looks exactly like the feature not working.
- [ ] Frozen build only: run the packaged app and confirm labels still
      render in Inter. The font is a `datas` entry, and PyInstaller exits 0
      when one resolves to nothing.

### Direct activation acceptance

These cases require live EVE clients. Run them with **Minimize inactive
clients** OFF first so minimization cannot hide an activation defect. The
expected result is one direct foreground request followed by observation, not
repeated foreground requests from timer turns.

- [ ] **Locked and unlocked clicks complete promptly with minimization off.**
      From EVE A, click EVE B's locked preview (dispatches on press), then its
      unlocked preview (dispatches on release). Expected: each accepted click
      produces one switch, B takes foreground promptly, and B's outline appears
      with no duplicate switch, pump stall, or late focus change.
- [ ] **Rapid supersession keeps the newest pending intent.** Start A -> B and
      immediately request C before B settles. Expected: C is the final
      foreground and outlined client; B never reappears later, and neither B nor
      C causes A to minimize while minimization is off. Repeat with a cycle
      command during the A -> B transition. Expected: the cycle anchors on B,
      so forward selects the client after B rather than restarting from A.
- [ ] **Input follows the observed foreground immediately.** After locked and
      unlocked clicks, a direct-character hotkey, and a cycle hotkey, type in
      chat and make a harmless mouse click without waiting. Expected: every
      event lands in the newly foreground EVE client. Repeat while holding the
      real push-to-talk key; the accepted switch still completes and the held
      key is not released, duplicated, or redirected.
- [ ] **A minimized target uses the bounded restore path.** Minimize B, then
      select it by click and hotkey. Expected: B restores and becomes foreground,
      its outline follows promptly, Wingman remains responsive, and no other
      client is marked or minimized while restoration is pending.
- [ ] **A retained browser or Windows Search cancels stale intent.** Focus a
      browser text field and then Windows Search; attempt a switch in a case
      where Windows keeps that application foreground and type immediately.
      Expected: input remains in the retained application, the EVE outline does
      not move speculatively, and no deadline fallback steals focus later.
- [ ] **Teardown clears pending foreground work.** Start a switch and quit
      Wingman immediately, before the target settles. Expected: the process
      exits fully, the current foreground remains usable, and no delayed
      fallback, outline update, minimize, or focus steal occurs after teardown.

### Reopen previews where you last put them

The checkbox on the previews card. It governs where a preview OPENS, at
launch and mid-session alike — a preview is created whenever its client
appears, so an item that only restarts the app tests half of it.

- [ ] On (the default): drag two previews somewhere deliberate, restart
      Wingman. Both come back exactly where they were.
- [ ] On: with Wingman already running, start a third client. Its preview
      appears at that character's saved position, not on the stack.
- [ ] Either setting: logging out to character selection in the same HWND/PID
      keeps the current rectangle. This is continuity, not reopening from a
      saved layout. Once another named character appears, this setting governs
      that character's placement normally.
- [ ] Off: quit that client and start it again. Its preview opens in the
      default stack, ignoring the saved rect.
- [ ] Off: drag a preview, switch the checkbox back on, restart. The drag
      you made while it was off is where the preview returns — positions
      are recorded whatever the setting says.
- [ ] **Multiple monitors with staggered tops**, either setting: start a
      character that has never had a preview. It lands fully on a display,
      not in the dead zone above one. The clamp runs on both paths, and an
      arrangement with aligned tops hides a failure here completely.
- [ ] Make `settings.json` read-only and toggle the checkbox. The hint
      below it says the choice will not survive a restart. The box stays
      where you put it — the setting really did change for this session.
- [ ] Nothing at any point moves or resizes an EVE client. The log has no
      line about placing or restoring a client window.

### Preview configuration options

Six settings on the Previews card: Labels, per-character Lock, Opacity,
Minimize inactive clients, and the two global defaults added with the
character table — Lock previews in place by default, and Default preview
size. None of this is covered by pytest — it needs a
real desktop and, for the minimize checks, two clients you can watch switch
foreground.

**Known risk:** **Minimize inactive clients** activates and marks the requested
client before it asynchronously requests `SW_SHOWMINNOACTIVE` for the exact
outgoing EVE HWND. That command minimizes without activating the next top-level
window, removing the observed minimize-first browser/desktop gap. Windows does
not report completion for `ShowWindowAsync`; a very rapid return to the outgoing
client can still race a late minimize request. Record source, target, foreground,
and any late minimize in that case.

- [ ] Labels off reclaims the character-name band and the mirrored video
      grows into it; labels on restores the band. Both take effect on
      already-open previews without a restart.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: a preview created while labels are OFF opens with the
      band already reclaimed.** With the Labels checkbox already off, start
      a new EVE client (or one that has never had a preview) so a preview is
      created fresh. `create()`'s thumbnail call site is the one
      `show_labels` site with no automated coverage — it needs a real
      `CreateWindowExW` and `Thumbnail.register` and cannot be reached from a
      Linux test. A band on a freshly created preview, with labels off, is
      the specific regression this item exists to catch.
- [ ] Opacity dims the mirrored video and leaves the border and label at
      full strength — drag the slider to its low end and confirm the chrome
      stays crisp while only the video fades.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: the button grammar.** Left click switches, left
      drag moves, right drag resizes, left+right drag resizes every
      preview at once — and the corner handle still resizes alone. Walk
      all of them: (a) click a preview and confirm the client comes
      forward **on release** — the switch is deferred past a 4px
      threshold now, because at press time it is not yet knowable whether
      the press is a click or a drag-move; (b) press and hold the left
      button without moving, then release: it still switches; (c) left
      drag a preview across the screen, confirm it moves and the
      position survives a restart; (d) right-drag one and confirm it
      resizes top-left-anchored; (e) press left, add right without
      releasing, and drag: every open preview resizes together, each
      keeping its own position. This item is most likely to generate
      "the previews are stuck" reports — matching EVE-O Preview's
      gesture set is the reason it was chosen.
- [ ] Grabbing the bottom-right corner resizes WITHOUT switching to that
      client. The corner is inside the preview, so a resize that also
      focused would drag a client to the foreground every time a layout
      is adjusted.
- [ ] A locked preview is FULLY inert to mouse gestures — no left-drag
      move, no right-drag resize, no corner resize, no left+right
      resize-all — while a left click on it still switches, **on the way
      down** (press-and-hold without moving: the switch happens during
      the hold, since a locked press can be nothing but a click and pays
      no classification delay). Check this **on a character who has
      never dragged their preview**, not just one that already has a
      saved position — that is the case the lock's own storage list
      exists for, since `locked` cannot ride in `preview.layouts`
      without a saved rect.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: locked and unlocked clicks focus the requested client.**
      Test one locked preview and one unlocked preview from each starting
      foreground: another EVE client, Windows Search, a browser text field,
      and Wingman. A click (on release when unlocked, on press when locked)
      must either put the requested EVE client in the foreground or leave the
      source application in the foreground if Windows refuses the switch; the
      preview itself must never become foreground. Type immediately after each
      attempt. The application that remains foreground must receive the input.
- [ ] **A held push-to-talk key does not prevent switching.** Hold the actual
      push-to-talk key used during play, click both a locked and an unlocked
      preview, and repeat with a character hotkey. Each accepted switch must
      reach the requested client while the key remains held.
- [ ] **Minimize inactive clients activates before minimizing.** With the
      checkbox on, switch from EVE A to EVE B. B must become foreground and its
      selection ring must move before A receives an asynchronous minimize. A
      never-minimize outgoing client is skipped entirely; a refused or pending
      activation minimizes nothing.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING browser-flash regression:** enable **Hide previews on lost
      focus** and **Minimize inactive clients**. Leave a maximized browser in
      front, switch to EVE A, then make the first EVE A -> EVE B switch. The
      browser remains visible until A takes foreground; on A -> B, B appears
      without a browser or desktop frame. Repeat through a preview click and a
      character hotkey.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: no late minimize after a rapid return.** With **Minimize
      inactive clients** on, rapidly switch EVE A -> EVE B -> EVE A, first while
      idle and then while B is busy loading grid or changing session. Repeat by
      preview click and character hotkey. **Fail** if A minimizes after the
      return, or foreground jumps to the browser or desktop; either means a
      delayed outgoing request still disrupted the client the user returned to.
- [ ] **A minimized target restores without stalling later input.** Switch
      repeatedly to a target that Minimize inactive clients put down. It must
      either restore and become foreground within about 500ms (25 non-blocking
      20ms retries) or stop retrying while Wingman remains responsive. Pending
      restoration minimizes nothing. After a successful retry, the target ring
      moves before Wingman asynchronously minimizes only the exact saved
      outgoing HWND; an exited or recreated outgoing client is logged and
      skipped. Start another click or hotkey immediately and confirm the newer
      request wins.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: a minimized client's preview keeps updating.** Minimize a
      client with visible motion — undocked, drones out, or the camera spinning.
      Do NOT use a docked ship on a static scene: it looks identical whether the
      thumbnail is live or frozen on its last frame, so that scene cannot tell
      you which one you saw. A frozen preview blocks the merge: minimize-inactive
      is not compatible with the previews it sits next to.

### Opacity is translucency, not dimming

Nothing in CI renders a preview window, so this is the only place the fix
is observed. Put something with COLOUR behind a preview before you start —
a browser on a white page, not the desktop wallpaper. Against a dark
background dimming and translucency look identical, which is how the
original bug survived a smoke pass.

- [ ] Drag a preview over that bright window, then Settings > Previews and
      pull Opacity down to roughly half. Expected: the bright window shows
      THROUGH the game content. If the preview merely goes darker and the
      window behind never appears, the thumbnail is still blending against
      `chrome.render`'s interior fill and the hole is not being punched.
- [ ] At the same setting, click the preview's middle. It must still take
      the click and raise its client. `THUMBNAIL_ALPHA` is 1 rather than 0
      for exactly this reason, and 0 would look identical right up until
      the click lands in whatever is behind.
- [ ] With labels ON, look along the top edge of the game content at a low
      opacity. There must be no 1px dark seam between the label band and
      the thumbnail — the band ends on the row before the hole starts.
- [ ] Leave opacity at 255 and confirm nothing changed: the tile reads as
      solid, and an unselected preview still shows its thin near-black
      edge. That edge is chrome, not fill, and must survive at every
      opacity.
- [ ] Trigger an alert while opacity is low. The ring must still draw at
      full strength — chrome is painted over the hole, not under it.

### Preview sizing

Aspect-locked resize handles, a per-character `Size…` dialog, the snapping
toggle, and Reset previews. The lock exists because a DWM thumbnail does
not letterbox a shape that does not match its client — it stretches to
fill the destination rect, so a mismatched preview has always been
distorting the game rather than wasting pixels around it (see
`docs/preview-roadmap.md`'s corrections). Nothing here renders under
pytest.

- [ ] Drag a preview's resize handle. The picture stays undistorted against
      the client's shape — not merely squarish-looking — and both a
      mostly-horizontal and a mostly-vertical drag change the size; a
      handle that only tracks one axis is not this feature.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: turn labels off in the Previews card, then drag the
      handle again.** The picture must still be undistorted with the label
      band gone. The window is the picture plus a fixed horizontal margin
      and a vertical margin that shrinks to just that margin once labels
      are off; a lock that assumes the band is always there is exactly
      the case the first draft of this design got wrong.
- [ ] **The handle must SHRINK, in both axes separately.** Drag a preview
      larger, release, then drag the handle back inward along X alone: the
      window gets smaller. Repeat along Y alone: smaller again. This is a
      regression guard, not a nicety — the first shipped lock believed
      whichever axis implied the larger picture, so on a rect already at
      the locked ratio (which is every rect after the first drag) an
      inward drag along one axis returned it byte-identical. Growing
      worked from either axis throughout, which is what made it read as a
      mystery rather than a limit.
- [ ] **Uncheck "Keep previews the same shape as their client", then drag
      the handle.** Each edge now moves freely and the picture visibly
      stretches — that is the documented cost, not a bug. Re-check it:
      the lock returns on the very next drag, with no restart. A preview
      already open when you flip it must obey, which is what the live
      restyle is for.
- [ ] **The off-ratio jump, which is accepted rather than fixed.** Give a
      preview a deliberately wrong shape (`Size…` something like `700x300`
      on a 16:9 client, or untick the box and drag it freeform, then
      re-tick), then drag the handle diagonally through the point where
      the horizontal and vertical travel are equal. The window jumps once,
      measured at ~145px, and is then correct for every later drag. This
      is the documented consequence of choosing an axis from the pointer;
      it must happen ONCE and must not recur on the same preview.
- [ ] Flip that checkbox in the MIDDLE of a resize drag (hold the handle,
      flip it with the other hand or a second monitor, keep dragging).
      The gesture in flight keeps the behaviour it started with; the
      change lands on the next drag. The flag is sampled at button-down
      on purpose.
- [ ] `Size…` on a running client: type `640x392`, confirm the preview
      resizes to it, and that the hint text named the client's own
      undistorted size before you typed anything.
- [ ] `Size…` on an offline character with a saved position: the size is
      accepted and applies the next time that client runs.
- [ ] `Size…` on a character with no saved position: refused, with the
      sentence telling you to start the client once first.
- [ ] Turn snapping off in the Previews card, then drag a preview next to
      another: no magnetism, it lands exactly where dropped. Turn it back
      on: magnetism returns immediately, without a restart.
- [ ] **Reset previews** — the `.btn.danger` button in the Previews card:
      a confirm dialog appears, accepting it returns every preview to the
      default stack, and locks, never-minimize and keybinds all survive
      the reset.
- [ ] Reset previews with previews switched off, then switch them back on:
      previews open at the default stack rather than any position they
      held before the reset.

## EVE preview hotkeys

- [ ] **The screenshot set does not replace interaction checks.** In Settings
      > Previews, open Configure for an online and an offline character, then
      close it. Focus stays on that row's Configure button on both actions;
      opening a second detail closes the first. On an opted-out row, Clear and
      Edit… may be disabled, but Configure stays live: open it and confirm the
      saved Cycle group and geometry controls remain reachable for re-enable.
      Change a Cycle group or Copy a saved placement, let the refresh repaint, and confirm focus returns to
      the contained control rather than the page body. Restart Wingman and
      confirm the saved group assignment and copied placement persist. These
      focus and persistence paths are intentionally not staged by the
      read-only screenshot shooter.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: `WM_HOTKEY` reaches the message-only host window.**
  Bind any chord and press it. If nothing happens while the log shows a
  successful registration, `HWND_MESSAGE` is not receiving the message and
  registration must move to `hWnd=NULL` with dispatch in the pump loop —
  see risk 4 in `docs/history/eve-preview-hotkeys-design.md`.
- [ ] A per-character chord switches to that client from another application
  (try it from a browser, not just from Wingman).
- [ ] **A direct-character burst ends at its final absolute target.** Alternate
  several character chords rapidly, finish on a known character, then stop.
  Expected: at most one final switch after the keys stop, it is to that last
  character, and no intermediate clients appear afterward.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: keyboard input lands promptly after foreground
  activation.** Switch with a character hotkey and, separately, by clicking its
  preview, then immediately type in EVE. Expected: the foreground target
  receives every keystroke without a focusless delay. Repeat with a previously
  minimized target. This behavior requires a live Windows desktop and cannot be
  verified by the automated suite.
- [ ] **A refused switch leaves keyboard focus in the retained application.**
  Open Windows Search and attempt a preview switch while Search remains in the
  foreground; type immediately and confirm Search receives the keystrokes.
  Repeat from a focused browser text field. Expected: when Windows retains
  either application instead of activating EVE, typing continues there rather
  than going nowhere.
- [ ] **A state update mid-hotkey-capture does not orphan or hide the capture.**
  With the Previews tab open and a hotkey row showing "Press a key…", start
  or close an EVE client (which pushes new state from Python). Expected: the
  row stays armed and visibly capturing, typing fills in normally, and a
  pressed chord binds correctly. The original bug left the row armed but
  invisible, eating keystrokes and binding them silently.
- [ ] All forward and back walk every running client in name order and wrap.
  **Try it with a browser focused, not just with an EVE client focused** —
  these are different branches of `_on_hotkey`: with an EVE client focused,
  cycling anchors on that client; with a browser (or anything else) focused,
  it falls back to the last-cycled target. The browser case is the one a
  multiboxer actually uses, so it must be checked, not just the EVE-focused
  case.
- [ ] **A cycle burst lands at its net destination.** With four clients in
  known name order and A foreground, press All forward three times rapidly
  and stop. Expected: the final target is D, with no intermediate clients
  appearing after the final switch. Repeat with mixed forward and back presses,
  calculate the destination first, and confirm Wingman lands there.
- [ ] **Holding a chord fires once, not at the key-repeat rate.** Hold it for
  three seconds; the client must not flicker through repeated activations.
- [ ] **A chord another application already owns is visible on the Previews
  tab**, not only in the log. Bind something a running app claims, restart
  Wingman, and check the tab BEFORE touching anything — this is the startup
  case where the push has no window to reach.
- [ ] Switching previews off releases the chords: they do nothing, and the
  application that owns them gets them back. Switching previews on reclaims
  them.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: an existing bind can be overwritten IN PLACE, with
  previews running.** Bind `Ctrl+Alt+F1` to a character, leave previews on,
  then click that same row and press `Ctrl+Alt+F1` again — do NOT clear it
  first. Expected: the row takes the chord. What the bug looked like: the
  row sat on "Press a key…" and the foreground jumped to the bound client
  instead, because a registered chord is delivered to the preview window as
  `WM_HOTKEY` and never reaches WebView2 at all. Clearing first was the
  workaround users found, and it worked for exactly that reason — so
  testing this with a cleared row tests nothing.
- [ ] **The same, for a chord a DIFFERENT row owns.** Press character A's
  chord while character B's row is armed. Expected: B takes it, A keeps it,
  and both rows show it — that is now a legal shared bind, not a clash.
- [ ] **Escape and clicking another row still cancel an armed capture**, and
  after either, the preview hotkeys work normally again on the very next
  press. A capture that fails to disarm leaves the host eating the next
  chord (for 30s, then it expires on its own).
- [ ] **Previews off: capture still works.** With previews off nothing is
  registered, so every key reaches the page directly. Both paths have to
  bind the same chord to the same row.
- [ ] **With previews off, the Previews tab reads as off, not as live.** Open
  the tab while previews are switched off. Expected: the banner above the
  list says previews are off, and every chord renders as neither registered
  nor refused — a dashed outline, with a tooltip saying it is not
  registered right now. No chord may render as an ordinary, live binding.

  Rows are **not** dimmed while previews are off. Dimming means "this
  character is logged off", and it only says that by contrast with an
  undimmed row; with the host stopped Python sends no character list at
  all, so dimming every row made the tab indistinguishable from one where
  everybody really had logged out. That was reported as "I don't see
  anything that indicates they are online".

  **And no row should carry the word `offline` here either**, for the same
  reason: that word is now the encoding and the dimming only reinforces
  it, so a row wearing it while previews are off makes the same false
  claim in text. With previews on and one client logged out, that row
  reads `<name> offline` and dims; the legend that used to sit above the
  first row is gone, because it had scrolled off for most of the rows it
  explained and on a typical fleet the dim rows are the majority anyway.

  Confirm independently rather than trusting the tab: from a separate
  probe process, `RegisterHotKey` must succeed for each of those chords.
  The original bug served the host's last snapshot after teardown; the
  2026-08-24 regression was the page reading an absent registration entry
  as a successful one. Both made the tab claim chords Windows did not hold.
- [ ] **A chord bound to a `Win+` combination never fires.** Windows owns a
  large share of `Win+`key and those chords cannot be taken by
  `RegisterHotKey`. Bind one (e.g. `Win+F1`) and press it: it must appear on
  the Previews tab as refused (same treatment as any other chord another
  application already owns), not as a chord that looks registered and
  silently never fires.
- [ ] **The character list updates when the Previews tab is opened.** While
  viewing another tab, start an EVE client. Switch to Previews. Expected: the
  new character appears in the list immediately without needing a restart or
  settings save.
- [ ] A binding made for a character survives a restart while that character
  is logged off, and still appears in the list.
- [ ] **Hotkey captures are tab-isolated.** Arm a bookmark hotkey on the
  Bookmarks tab, switch to Previews, arm a preview hotkey, press a chord.
  Expected: only the preview binding is written. Check the Bookmarks tab
  afterwards: the bookmark hotkey unchanged. The original bug wrote to both,
  leaving an off-screen binding the user never saw.
- [ ] With EVE bookmarks enabled and a window enabled, binding a preview chord
  that matches a bookmark bind shows the collision warning. With bookmarks
  disabled, it does not warn.
- [ ] **Dimmed rows are visibly less prominent than normal.** Find an offline
  character. Then create a latent collision: configure a preview chord that
  matches a bookmark chord, then disable EVE bookmarks (or un-tick every window
  in the Bookmarks tab's enabled-window list) so the collision is not active.
  Expected: both the offline character and the latent-collision row read
  noticeably quieter than normal rows, not more prominent. A visual regression
  here reverses the hierarchy.
- [ ] **Quitting leaves input queues and hotkeys released.** After several
  click, direct-hotkey, cycle, refused, and minimized-target attempts, quit
  Wingman from the tray. Type in the foreground EVE client and in another
  application; input must stay with the focused window, with no stuck keys or
  keystrokes arriving in a different client. The preview chords must be
  available to another application without a reboot. Relaunch Wingman and
  confirm the chords register and switch normally again.

### Preview cycle groups

**Windows and real EVE clients required; not verifiable by the automated suite.**

- [ ] **Existing All forward/back chords behave exactly as before on an upgraded
  settings file with no groups.** Open an install with existing cycle binds but
  no groups configured. Expected: the rows remain labelled All forward and
  All back and the chords cycle every running client as before.
- [ ] **Create DPS and Logistics, assign online and offline characters, and confirm
  each group chord visits only its running assigned members.** Bind a chord to
  each group. Pressing DPS's chord must never land on a Logistics member,
  and offline members of either group must be skipped.
- [ ] **From a foreground member, a foreground nonmember, and a browser, verify the
  anchor/history behavior (design decision 3).** With a group active: from a
  group member in the foreground, cycling advances from that member; from a
  group nonmember in the foreground, the anchor is missing and the action starts
  at the group's first running member; from a browser, the group falls back to
  its last-cycled target.
- [ ] **Alternate All, DPS, Logistics, and direct-character hotkeys rapidly; the
  final client matches sequential meaning without displaying intermediate
  targets.** Calculate the expected endpoint from the action sequence first.
  No wrong client appears after the burst ends.
- [ ] **Opt a member out of previews.** Expected: its group assignment remains
  selected in the UI, its direct-focus chord is released, and its group cycle
  skips it. Re-enable Preview for that character and it rejoins the group cycle
  without needing reassignment.
- [ ] **Rename a group while previews run.** Expected: the chord remains
  registered and membership is unchanged; no reconfiguration is needed and
  the renamed group cycles correctly on the very next press.
- [ ] **Delete a populated group.** Expected: the confirmation names the exact
  number of assignments, the chord is released immediately, every former
  member still cycles under All only — no reassignment, no crash — and every
  former member's visible assignment selector reads **All only** after deletion.
- [ ] **Log members in and out during repeated cycling.** Expected: no wrong
  client, no stale window handle, no crash, and no stuck hotkey over an
  extended session of login/logout churn.
- [ ] **Arm a named-group keybind capture, then trigger a roster push by opening
  or closing a client.** Expected: the capture row stays visible and armed;
  the next chord binds correctly. The original bug left an armed row invisible
  after any state push.
- [ ] **At 840x625, inspect the full card with long group and character names.**
  Expected: no sixth column, no horizontal clipping, no native light control,
  and the group value control is reachable by keyboard. Check at 150% scaling
  as well (the CSS viewport remains 840x625).

## Shared preview keybinds

- [ ] **One chord on several characters is accepted and NOT marked as a
  clash.** Bind `Ctrl+Alt+F1` to two characters. Expected: neither row goes
  clash-red; hovering either says it is shared with the other. (Before this
  change the second row was an error, and only the alphabetically-first
  character ever responded.)
- [ ] **It goes to whoever is logged in.** With only the second character
  running, press the shared chord. Expected: it switches to that character —
  not a silent no-op because the first one is offline.
- [ ] **With both running, a press always moves you.** Press it repeatedly
  from one of the two clients. Expected: it goes to the OTHER one rather
  than re-focusing the client already in front.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: a burst of presses ends when the keys stop.** With
  two clients running, alternate their character chords as fast as you
  can for a couple of seconds, then STOP and hold still. Expected: at
  most ONE more switch happens — to whichever client you pressed LAST —
  and then the desktop is still. The bug this pins: every press used to
  be a queued, fully-executed switch, so after a burst the clients kept
  trading places on their own. Also check the press for the client you
  are ALREADY on costs nothing: no minimize, no visible flicker, no
  delay — it is a recognised no-op now.
- [ ] **Input lands immediately after a switch.** Switch to a client
  with a hotkey (and separately, by clicking its preview) and
  immediately — within a fraction of a second — type a character or
  click a UI button in the game. Expected: the input goes to that
  client at once. The bug this pins: the switch left the client
  foreground but focusless, and roughly the first 0.5-1s of input was
  swallowed. Try it on a client that was MINIMIZED before the switch —
  the async restore is the likeliest moment for a relapse.
- [ ] **A character chord that collides with a cycle chord is still a
  clash.** Bind `Ctrl+Alt+Right` to a character while it is also Cycle
  forward. Expected: both rows go red and the tooltip says the cycle keybind
  is the one that loses — those two cannot share a registration.

## The floating sig bar

Nothing in the suite can open a second window, so every item here is a
manual check by construction.

- [ ] **The bar has no taskbar presence.** With the bar open, hover
      Wingman's taskbar icon: only the main window's preview appears.
      Expected: no second entry, no aero preview for the bar, and
      therefore no X to close it with. (The bar now carries
      WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW; before this it shipped a taskbar button like a
      real window.)
- [ ] **Toggling cannot be desynced by a repaint.** Toggle the bar off
      from Wingman, then hover/minimise/restore windows and click
      around the desktop. Expected: the bar stays hidden. The bug this
      pins: the toggle wrote its state at a window object that an
      external close had already killed, and any repaint resurrected a
      bar the GUI believed hidden.
- [ ] **The GUI toggle is the only way the bar changes, and it always
      recovers.** With the bar open, toggle it off and on from
      Settings/strip: it reappears at its last position. (Historical:
      an externally-closed bar used to stay dead until Wingman was
      restarted; the toggle now detects the dead window and rebuilds
      it. The aero-preview close that triggered this no longer exists,
      so the recovery path is exercised by toggling rapidly while the
      bar is still initialising.)

- [ ] **The bar opens, floats, and stays on top.** Click the `⌒`-style
      toggle at the right end of the status strip with the bookmark engine
      running. Expected: a small bar reading `SIG ... ROOT ... NEXT ...`
      appears near the bottom-left of the screen and stays visible over
      OBS and over an EVE client, not just over Wingman.
- [ ] **The width hugs the text.** Let the engine tick into a new root or
      NEXT value. Expected: the bar re-fits to the new text with no dead
      space to its right and no clipped digits, at 100% and at 150%
      scaling.
- [ ] **Drag it and restart.** Drag the bar somewhere deliberate, quit
      Wingman, relaunch. Expected: the bar reopens exactly where it was
      left, and the status-strip toggle shows active on load without a
      click.
- [ ] **Degraded states read as degraded.** Stop the engine (untick
      Register keybinds in EVE). Expected: the bar shows em-dashes in the
      muted colour, never a stale root system that looks live.
- [ ] **Only the background fades.** Settings › Bookmarks ›
      Floating sig bar: drag Opacity to 0. Expected: the background
      disappears entirely while the text stays at full strength —
      the alpha lives on the page background, never on the window.
- [ ] **Colour and opacity persist.** Pick a background colour, reload the
      Settings page. Expected: the picker hydrates to the stored colour,
      and the bar wears it live without a restart.

## Floating Fleet combat bar

The Fleet Bar is a separate always-on-top WebView fed by the shared EVE
client discovery and gamelog stream. It is display-only and must remain
independent of both preview thumbnails and alert preferences.

- [ ] **Enable from Settings › Previews.** Tick `Show the floating Fleet DPS /
      EWAR bar`. Expected: a compact three-column window opens with
      `CHARACTER`, `DAMAGE` (with `OUT` and `IN` sublabels either side of a
      center axis), and `EWAR`; the Settings checkbox and status-strip `DPS`
      button both show active.
- [ ] **OUT is always left, IN is always right, adjacent to EWAR.** With at
      least two visible characters showing nonzero outgoing and incoming
      values, confirm each row's Damage cell reads outgoing value, its rail
      growing left from the center axis, then the axis, then incoming value
      and rail growing right, immediately followed by the EWAR cell. Expected:
      this OUT-left/IN-right order never changes between quiet and active
      rows.
- [ ] **The quick toggle is the same setting.** Turn the bar off and on from
      the status strip, then from Settings. Expected: both controls follow each
      change immediately, no second window appears, and the hidden window
      returns without a WebView startup pause.
- [ ] **It runs independently.** Turn client previews and gamelog alerts off,
      leave Fleet Bar on, and restart Wingman. Expected: the Fleet Bar restores,
      `eve-discovery`, `gamelog-stream`, and `telemetry-dispatch` are running,
      and no preview window or alert sound is required for values to update.
- [ ] **Roster includes every logged-in client.** Run several clients, exclude
      one under Preview configuration, and leave another at character select.
      Expected: every logged-in character appears exactly once in alphabetical
      order, including the preview-excluded one; the character-select client has
      no row until its title identifies a character.
- [ ] **Character grouping is truthful.** In Settings › Previews ›
      Fleet combat bar, open **Characters** after Wingman has seen several
      characters. With Fleet Bar on, running names are under `Running` and
      remembered logged-out names are under `Offline`; no name appears twice.
      Turn Fleet Bar off: the same choices are editable under `Known characters`,
      without calling anyone Offline. Turn it on and wait for its first roster:
      the Running/Offline groups replace Known characters.
- [ ] **Hide and restore every position.** With at least three visible running
      characters, hide then restore the first, middle, and final row from the
      Characters disclosure. Expected: each change immediately removes or
      returns only that Fleet Bar row; the checkbox remains available to restore
      a hidden row, and alphabetical order of remaining rows is preserved.
- [ ] **All-hidden state remains usable.** Hide every running character.
      Expected: the still-open bar says `All running characters are hidden.`,
      has no row/count/badge that exposes a hidden name, and can be dragged from
      its header only, leaving the roster area scrollable. Restore one character and confirm
      its row returns immediately.
- [ ] **Visibility never resets live metrics.** While one character has live
      outgoing DPS and/or an active `SCRAM/POINT`, hide it and restore it before
      the metric naturally expires. Expected: its current DPS/tackle state
      returns immediately; hiding did not restart collection or reset metrics.
- [ ] **Choices survive restart and offline time.** Hide a character, quit and
      relaunch Wingman while that character is offline. Expected: it remains an
      unticked restoration control in `Offline` (or `Known characters` while
      Fleet Bar is off). Restore it while offline, then log it in: it appears in
      the bar without another Settings change.
- [ ] **Fleet visibility is separate from Preview, Alerts, and keybinds.** Hide
      a running character from Fleet, then independently exclude/include it in
      Preview configuration, trigger an alert, and use Preview keybinds. Expected:
      each feature follows only its own setting; Fleet hiding neither suppresses
      previews/alerts/keybinds nor is changed by Preview exclusion.
- [ ] **No log is not zero, for either direction.** Point Gamelogs at a folder
      with no current log for one running character. Expected: that row's
      Damage cell says `NO LOG` once, spanning both OUT and IN, rather than a
      fabricated `0` on either side; restoring a current log changes it to
      numeric outgoing and incoming values without reopening the bar. A
      character genuinely dealing and receiving no damage instead shows `0` on
      both sides with empty rails — `0` and `NO LOG` must never be confused.
- [ ] **Outgoing direct and drone damage both count.** Produce weapon and drone
      hits from one character. Expected: its outgoing (`OUT`, left of the
      center axis) value is total outgoing damage in the trailing 10 seconds
      divided by 10, rounded to a whole number. Incoming damage does not
      increase it.
- [ ] **Incoming DPS is calculated independently, on the same fixed window.**
      Have another ship damage a displayed character while it deals no damage
      itself. Expected: its incoming (`IN`, right of the center axis, adjacent
      to `EWAR`) value is total incoming damage in the trailing 10 seconds
      divided by 10, rounded to a whole number, using the same fixed
      ten-second denominator as outgoing; outgoing damage from that character
      does not increase it.
- [ ] **The DPS window decays on event time, for both directions.** Stop
      dealing and receiving damage and watch the row. Expected: both OUT and
      IN fall independently as events leave the fixed 10-second window and
      each reaches `0` without another combat line arriving; neither ever
      divides by only the active portion of the window.
- [ ] **Each rail normalizes independently against only the visible rows.**
      With at least three visible running characters producing different
      outgoing and incoming values, confirm the longest OUT rail belongs to
      the highest visible outgoing value and the longest IN rail belongs to
      the highest visible incoming value, independently of each other. Hide
      the character currently leading one direction. Expected: only that
      direction's rails rescale to the new highest visible value; the other
      direction's rails are unaffected, no row moves, and equal rail lengths
      on opposite sides never imply equal DPS.
- [ ] **A changing leader never moves a row.** Cause the highest outgoing or
      incoming character to change (by damage change or by hiding/restoring
      rows). Expected: rail lengths on the affected side rescale; row order
      stays case-insensitively alphabetical and no row changes position.
- [ ] **Maximum supported values render in full; larger values are explicit.**
      Drive or simulate a value at exactly `10,000,000` on one side. Expected:
      the full number renders without truncation, ellipsis, or overlap with
      the center axis or `EWAR`. A value above that bound instead shows `>10m`
      and its accessible description reads "more than 10 million DPS" for that
      side, never a raw expanded number.
- [ ] **Incoming EWAR remains distinct during combat activity.** Have another
      ship point, scram, and neut a displayed character. Expected: distinct
      `POINT`, `SCRAM`, and `NEUT` labels appear under `EWAR`, including in
      combination, with the full `SCRAM · POINT · NEUT` text visible and
      unclipped when all three are active. Another tracked EWAR event or
      outgoing damage from that character refreshes the shared activity
      window; incoming damage alone does not. All labels clear after
      30 seconds without that activity; relogging or replacing the active log
      source clears them immediately. Outgoing neuts and nos never appear.
- [ ] **Reader degradation is explicit and non-destructive.** Temporarily make
      the Gamelogs folder unreadable or pause its updates. Expected: the header
      changes to `STALE` or `ERROR` and retains the last good rows. Recovery
      clears the diagnostic. Removing the folder entirely shows `NO LOG FOLDER`
      and resets source bindings instead of carrying old DPS into a new folder.
- [ ] **Drag, pinning, and persistence.** Drag from the name, number, header,
      and empty-state surfaces. Expected: every pixel moves the bar, no text is
      interactive, and it remains above both EVE and other applications. At
      100%, 125%, 150%, and 200% scaling, open and close the Characters
      disclosure, add/remove visible rows near every work-area edge, and confirm
      both the Settings card and bar fit without clipping. Quit and relaunch at
      each scale; the bar restores at the saved logical position with no clipping
      or white first-frame flash.
- [ ] **Characters disclosure preserves state and keyboard focus.** In real
      WebView2, open and close **Characters** with Enter and Space. Expected:
      closed content is not visible; an open disclosure stays open across live
      roster updates and visibility saves. Tab to a character checkbox and test
      a successful hide/restore, a 65th-hide refusal, an instrumented bridge
      failure, a deliberately stale response, and a running/offline row move.
      After every terminal path the checkbox is re-enabled; if focus fell to the
      page body it returns to that character's current checkbox, but deliberate
      focus movement to another control is never stolen.
- [ ] **Shutdown leaves one clean generation.** Toggle Fleet, Previews, and
      Alerts through several combinations, then quit. Expected: no duplicate
      discovery/gamelog/dispatcher threads ever appear, and Wingman leaves Task
      Manager after all three shared workers and both floating WebViews stop.

## EVE preview alerts

When a player shoots, scrambles or decloaks one of your logged-in
characters, that client's preview pulses in a colour and a sound plays.
This subsystem is window and audio-only — nothing in it can be tested
headless.

### Verifiable now

- [ ] **Alerts own no private reader thread.** Check Task Manager's process
      detail tab or run `threading.enumerate()` in a Python debug console.
      Expected: no thread named `wingman-alerts` exists in any setting
      combination. With Previews and Alerts on, the shared `gamelog-stream`
      and `telemetry-dispatch` threads run; turning Alerts off while Fleet Bar
      remains on does not restart either one.
- [ ] **Turn alerts on with no Gamelogs folder set.** Open Settings >
      Alerts and tick **Watch gamelogs and raise alerts** without setting a
      Gamelogs folder. Expected: the Gamelog alerts card displays "Your EVE
      Gamelogs folder is not set. Alerts cannot run without it — set it in
      the card below."
- [ ] **Set the folder.** Browse to your EVE Gamelogs folder in Settings › Alerts,
      then check the Gamelog alerts card above it. Expected: it reports the
      number of characters being watched — e.g. "Watching gamelogs — 3
      characters online."
- [ ] **Change the Gamelogs folder while running.** With the Alerts card
      open and showing a character list, change the path in Settings ›
      Alerts' Gamelog folder card and check the alerts card again. Expected:
      the count re-derives from the new folder without restarting the app —
      the card updates to show the
      characters in the new Gamelogs.
- [ ] **Run a Sleeper site.** In a wormhole, start a Sleeper combat site
      with alerts active. Expected: no combat alerts fire — incoming attacks
      from NPCs are dropped by the PvE filter. Uncheck the PvE filter in the
      Alerts card and run another site. Expected: alerts fire normally.
- [ ] **Alt-tab between two logged-in clients repeatedly.** With both
      previews visible, switch focus between them. Expected: the selection
      ring (a thin outline marking the foreground client) follows the focused
      client, and the switch does not feel slower than it did before alerts
      were enabled.
- [ ] **Alt-tab to a browser or other non-EVE window.** With previews
      visible, switch focus away from EVE. Expected: every preview loses its
      selection ring (the thin outline marking the foreground client).
- [ ] **Confirm sounds play in the frozen build.** This is the only place
      the winsound module's packaging entry can be verified. Launch the
      installed build, trigger an alert, and confirm you hear the sound.
      At any volume below 100 the file played is a scaled copy written to
      %LOCALAPPDATA%\\FlyGD Wingman\\tmp, not the bundled asset — so this
      item now also proves that directory is writable in an installed
      build. Check the copy appears there the first time a quiet alert
      fires.
- [ ] **An alert on the client you are flying is silent but visible.** With
      two clients logged in and previews on, be in client A and have client
      B shoot at A (or run a site so A takes fire). Expected: A's preview
      flashes and NO sound plays. The flash fades on its own even with
      "Keep pulsing until you select the preview" ticked — you are already
      on that client, so there is nothing left to acknowledge.
- [ ] **The same alert on a client you are NOT flying still makes a noise.**
      From client A, have B take fire. Expected: B's preview flashes and the
      sound plays. This is the half of the pair that must not regress —
      silence here is the feature failing.
- [ ] **Alt-tab to a browser, then take fire on the client you just left.**
      Expected: the sound plays. Focus is nobody once you leave EVE, so the
      client you last flew is no longer exempt.
- [ ] **Alert volume.** Settings > Alerts, drag Volume. Expected: the
      readout tracks the thumb while dragging, and nothing is written until
      you release. Press Test at 100, 40 and 0. Expected: audibly quieter at
      40, completely silent at 0, and the difference between 100 and 40 is
      obvious rather than marginal. Restart and confirm the level survived.
- [ ] **Flashes and Speed.** Set Combat to 8 flashes / Slow and press Test.
      Expected: a visibly longer, slower pulse than the default. Set it to
      1 flash / Fast: a single quick blip. Both controls commit on change
      and survive a restart. An alert already pulsing when you change them
      finishes at its old rate — the values are read when an alert is
      armed, not per frame.
- [ ] **Advanced pulse behavior opens and closes by keyboard, and fits at
      the 840px floor.** Settings > Alerts. Expected: `#alert-advanced`
      starts collapsed under the table, titled `Advanced pulse behavior`.
      Tab to its summary and press Enter or Space — no mouse required — to
      open it; press it again to close it. With it open at the 840x625
      window floor, `document.documentElement.scrollWidth` must equal
      `clientWidth`, and none of its three rows (Combat, Warp scramble,
      Decloak) wraps its Flashes/Speed pair onto a second line.
- [ ] **Opening it does not disturb the card's live regions.** With the
      disclosure open or closed, `#alerts-health` and `#alerts-status`
      (both `role="status"`) keep whatever text they already held —
      alerts.js has no listener on `#alert-advanced`'s `toggle` event, so a
      screen reader must not re-announce either line just because the
      disclosure state changed.
- [ ] **Alert colours stay distinct without native chrome.** Open Settings >
      Alerts. Each event offers the same five swatches: Red, Amber, Green,
      Cyan, and Magenta — one line, vertically centered with the checkbox/
      name, Sound and Test beside it, not a two-line control. Each swatch
      announces its colour name to a screen reader (`aria-label`) and shows
      it in its tooltip; nothing prints the selected name visibly below the
      dots any more. Event boxes align with the modifier boxes below; event
      names and the Flashes/Speed line share the next inset, so no checkbox
      hangs by itself at the card edge. They render as dark-theme controls
      rather than opening a native Windows colour picker. Give two enabled
      events the same colour. Expected: one warning below the table names
      both events and says their preview pulses are indistinguishable; the
      warning is not repeated under both rows. Disable either event or
      choose a distinct colour and it clears without clearing a row-local
      save error.

### The alert render path

`PreviewHost._apply_alerts` arms the named character's preview and starts an
80ms tick timer that runs only while something is armed. The eight items below
were blocked on that and are now live.

Two things decide what you should see, and they are easy to conflate:

- **Persistent alerts** (`Persist` on, the default) clear when you *switch to*
  that client — by clicking its preview, by a cycle keybind, or by plain
  alt-tab. All three land in `PreviewWindow.set_focused`, which is the
  foreground and **not** the ring: the ring is sticky and sitting on a client
  while you read Discord must never count as having seen its alert.
- **Timed alerts** (`Persist` off) run their configured duration and are
  **not** cut short by selecting the client. That is deliberate:
  `alerts/state.py:75-83` refuses to acknowledge a timed alert so selecting a
  client cannot kill a ring that has only just appeared.

- [ ] **Take fire from a player.** In a wormhole with your preview visible,
      have another player shoot your character with weapons. Expected: the
      preview pulses in the configured colour and keeps pulsing while you are
      focused on a different application (e.g. a browser). With `Persist` on,
      it stops when you switch back to that EVE client; with `Persist` off it
      stops on its own after the configured duration.
- [ ] **Change a setting while an alert is pulsing.** With a ring pulsing on
      some preview, go to Settings › Previews and move the opacity slider (or
      toggle labels, or lock that preview). Expected: the ring keeps its full
      6px width for the rest of the alert. If it thins to brackets at the
      sides and bottom, `_restyle` has re-pushed the thumbnail at `BORDER`
      instead of the window's live `_inset`.
- [ ] **Take fire on the client that is wearing the ring.** Same as above,
      but make sure the shot character is the one you most recently switched
      to, then tab out to a browser and leave it there. Expected: the alert
      is **persistent** — it keeps pulsing until you switch back or click it,
      exactly as for any other client. The ring being on it is not "you are
      looking at it". If it instead expires after ~1.2s, `arm_alert` is
      reading `selected` where it must read `focused`.
- [ ] **Click the pulsing preview to clear it.** While the preview is
      pulsing from a **persistent** alert, click anywhere on it. Expected: the
      ring clears immediately **even if the client does not come to the
      foreground** — clicking the preview is its own action. This is
      window.py:102-116's expected failure mode before a click goes through
      to EVE.
- [ ] **Drag an alerting preview.** Start a combat that generates alerts on a
      visible client, then drag its preview to a new position. Expected: the
      preview moves smoothly. **The pulse is expected to hold one frame for
      the duration of the drag** and resume in phase on release — `WM_TIMER`
      is synthesized only when the thread queue is empty, and a drag keeps it
      full at a measured 320 mouse-moves/s. A frozen ring here is correct
      behaviour, not a bug; a stuttering *window* is a bug.
- [ ] **Quit an EVE client mid-alert.** Start combat that generates alerts,
      then close that client's window while the preview is pulsing. Expected:
      no crash, and the alert timer stops (the preview disappears within ~1s
      as the client exits). The app remains responsive.
- [ ] **DPI scaling: on a 150% or 200% display, both rings are visible.**
      With a monitor at 150% or 200% Windows display scaling, arm an alert
      and observe the pulsing preview. Expected: both the normal 2px selection
      ring (outline of the focused client) and the 6px alert pulsing ring are
      clearly visible at their designed size, not bleeding together or
      becoming indistinct.
- [ ] **Alt-tab between clients with an active alert.** With a **timed**
      alert armed on one client, switch focus away and back to that client.
      Expected: the alert ring pulses regardless of which client is focused,
      and returning to the alerted client does **not** cut it short. Repeat
      with `Persist` on: returning to that client clears the ring, because
      selecting it is what acknowledges it. This is the contrast with the
      selection ring, which only ever appears on the foreground client.
- [ ] **Press Test on each event type.** In the Alerts card, for each of
      the three events (Combat, Warp scramble, Decloak), click its Test
      button. Expected: the ring pulses on a character's preview in the
      configured colour, a sound plays, and the ring stops on its own after
      a few seconds — a test alert is never persistent.
- [ ] **Resize a preview past 640x480 while alerting.** Start an alert that
      makes a preview pulse, then drag its bottom-right corner to enlarge it
      past 640x480 pixels. Expected: the pulse transitions from a six-step
      pulse to a two-step blink, nothing leaks outside the preview bounds,
      the window does **not** snap back to its pre-drag size, and the effect
      continues until the alert clears. Resize smaller than 640x480 again;
      the six-step pulse returns. The snap-back is the specific regression to
      watch for: `UpdateLayeredWindow` takes its size from the pushed image,
      so a stale frame cache resizes the window under the drag.

## EVE preview crop prototype (Phase 0)

This is the Phase 0 engineering probe for cropped preview regions
(`docs/preview-evolution-crops-design.md`), run only through the
checkout-only `tests/manual/preview_crop_harness.py` — never through the
installed app. This probe is separate from the unreleased production crop
implementation: nothing in the probe writes settings, persists a layout, or
survives a restart. Every threshold a result
below is checked against is fixed in advance in
`docs/preview-crop-prototype-results.md`; record observed values there, not
in this checklist.

Requires a Windows machine with at least one EVE client logged in to a named
character for `pick`; the `load` path's stages (1, 2, 4, 8) each need that
many simultaneously running named clients or it stops before them. Commands
and safety boundaries are in `tests/manual/README.md`; both subcommands
require the full `--i-understand-this-is-an-ephemeral-windows-probe` flag.

- [ ] **Single-instance refusal.** With the installed Wingman (or its 3.x
      predecessor) running, launch either `pick` or `load`. Expected: it
      refuses immediately with `crop probe failure: FlyGD Wingman (or its 3.x
      predecessor) is already running; close it before running the crop
      probe` and opens no window. Close the installed app and confirm the
      same command now starts.
- [ ] **Picker correctness on each available DPI scale.** Run `pick` on a
      monitor at 100%, 125%, 150%, and 200% display scaling (whichever this
      machine has). Drag a selection in the picker, confirm, and compare the
      resulting crop's edges against the picker's own selection. Expected:
      every source edge lands within 2 source pixels of the dragged
      selection at every scale tested. Record the scales actually available
      on this machine and the observed deltas in the results document; a
      scale this machine cannot produce is recorded as untested, not passing.
- [ ] **Negative-coordinate monitor.** If this machine has a monitor
      positioned left of or above the primary (negative virtual-desktop
      coordinates), run `pick` with the client on that monitor. Expected: the
      mapped source rectangle is exactly as correct as on the primary
      monitor. Skip and record "no negative-coordinate monitor available" if
      this machine has none.
- [ ] **Selection cancel and client-loss cancel.** Start `pick`, begin a drag
      selection, then press Escape. Expected: the picker closes, no crop
      opens, and the probe keeps running — but no second picker appears. The
      probe offers one picker per process, ever: cancelling is a decision,
      not a transient failure, so selecting again means ending the run and
      starting `pick` afresh (see `tests/manual/README.md`).
      Separately, start `pick`, and while the picker is open, close the
      target EVE client. Expected: the picker closes on its own with no crop
      created and no crash.
- [ ] **Crop click/move/right-resize grammar.** With a crop open (via `pick`
      or a `load` stage), confirm: left click activates the owning EVE
      client (foreground request through the same activation path a primary
      preview uses); left drag moves the crop; right drag resizes it. The
      locked variant of this grammar is a Phase 1 pre-release gate, not a
      step here — the probe's CLI wires no lock roster (see the deferred
      list below).
- [ ] **Source aspect preservation.** Resize a crop with a right-drag from
      anywhere on it -- the reduced grammar has no corner handle; any
      right-button drag resizes. Expected: the crop's destination rectangle
      keeps the aspect ratio of the SOURCE region that was selected (or,
      for a load-stage crop, the central region it derived) — the picture
      never stretches or letterboxes as the crop window is resized.
- **Primary-lock independence and hide-on-lost-focus behavior** — *moved to
  the Phase 1 pre-release gates below.* The probe's CLI constructs the host
  with no `locked`, `lock_default` or `hide_on_lost_focus` provider, so neither
  behavior can be exercised from the harness; there is nothing to tick here.
- [ ] **Logout to character select, exit, and same-character new-HWND
      rebinding.** With a crop open on a named character, log that character
      out to character select without closing the client. Expected: the crop
      closes; it must never remain bound to the now-anonymous client. Close
      the EVE client entirely from character select. Expected: no orphan
      crop or HWND remains. Finally, log the SAME character back in on a new
      client process. Expected: the crop reopens against the new HWND with
      no operator action at all — a `load` stage crop is re-derived from the
      new client's central region, and an interactive crop is replayed from
      the selection the probe retained in memory. The picker does NOT reopen
      and must not be re-run: one picker per process still holds.
- [ ] **Minimize/restore behavior recorded as live, frozen, black, or
      stale.** Minimize the crop's source EVE client, then restore it.
      Record in the results document which of live / frozen / black / stale
      the crop showed while minimized, and confirm it returns to live video
      on restore. A frozen/black/stale result here is not a failure by
      itself — the design doc explicitly does not require the first crop
      release to solve minimized content — but it must not trigger a
      repeating DWM recovery attempt (see the DWM warning item below).
- [ ] **Partial/full occlusion.** With a crop visible, drag another window
      to partially cover it, then fully cover it, then uncover it again.
      Expected: the crop keeps rendering current video throughout (DWM
      composites regardless of on-screen coverage) and shows no stale frame
      once uncovered.
- **Primary alert pulse while dragging a crop** — *moved to the Phase 1
  pre-release gates below.* The probe's CLI wires no alert service, so no
  primary preview ever pulses during a probe run; there is nothing to tick
  here.
- [ ] **Stages 1/2/4/8 (1 crop, 2 crops, 4 crops, 8 crops) with metrics.**
      Run `load` with `WINGMAN_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` and `WINGMAN_PREVIEW_PERF=1`
      set (see `tests/manual/README.md`). At each stage the machine can
      fill, record CPU, GPU, working-set, HWND count, activation latency,
      and drag inter-event-gap numbers into the matching stage column of
      `docs/preview-crop-prototype-results.md`, checked against the
      thresholds fixed there. Stop at the first stage the machine cannot
      fill or that fails a threshold, and record that stopping point rather
      than omitting it.
- [ ] **DWM warning inspection under `WINGMAN_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`.** With that
      variable set (see the DPI-line note under EVE client previews, above,
      for the `WSLENV` caveat if launching from WSL), inspect
      `uploader_debug.log` for `DwmRegisterThumbnail failed` or a nonzero
      update HRESULT during normal crop operation. Expected: none during
      successful runs; any that appear must not repeat on every ~700 ms
      sweep — a repeating warning is a stage failure, not background noise.
- [ ] **Full teardown and Task Manager process/thread check.** Press Enter
      to end the probe (or Ctrl+C). Expected: the process exits fully, Task
      Manager shows no lingering `python`/harness process, and no crop HWND
      remains (checkable with a window-inspection tool such as Spy++ or
      `WinObjEx64` if available; otherwise confirm no crop is visible and the
      process is gone). Ctrl+C specifically prints the single line `crop
      probe interrupted` and exits `130` — no traceback; a traceback here is
      a regression, not cosmetic, because it is indistinguishable at a glance
      from an unclean teardown.
- [ ] **Real EVE client rectangles and maximized state never change.**
      Explicitly compare each source EVE client's window rectangle (position
      and size) and maximized/restored state before and after every
      scenario above — picking, moving, resizing, staging, minimizing,
      logging out, and closing a crop. Expected: identical in every case.
      This is the product's hard boundary, not a performance nicety, and it
      is checked explicitly rather than assumed from the crop behaving
      correctly.

**Deferred to Phase 1 — not proven by this prototype.** The following are
production-only behaviors this checkout-only harness does not implement and
cannot exercise; do not record them as passing or failing here. Each one is
a named **pre-release gate**: it must be exercised against the production
crop feature before any release that ships crops, and the corresponding
blocker is listed in `docs/preview-crop-prototype-results.md`.

- Restart persistence (the prototype writes no settings and restores no
  layout across a relaunch).
- Transactional candidate-and-swap reselection (the harness's picker
  confirm creates a crop directly; there is no hidden-candidate/rollback
  path to test).
- Settings rollback on a failed persistence write (there is no persistence
  at all).
- Roster/master-switch (`preview.enabled`) suppression and reconciliation
  behavior for crops (the harness subclasses `PreviewHost` directly and has
  no Settings UI or master toggle of its own).
- **Secondary lock independence and locked-primary toggle.** The probe's CLI
  does not exercise production lock settings. The production gate: with
  `preview.locked` applied to a character, its secondary remains movable and
  resizable; right-clicking the locked primary toggles an existing secondary
  off and on without changing the saved source or placement.
- **Hide-on-lost-focus lockstep.** The CLI passes no `hide_on_lost_focus`
  provider either, so the probe's previews and crops never hide. The
  production gate: with the setting enabled, crops hide and reappear in
  lockstep with the primary previews on the same foreground transitions.
- **Primary alert pulse while dragging a crop.** The probe wires no alert
  service, so no primary preview pulses during a probe run. The production
  gate: with an alert armed on a client whose crop is also open, moving and
  resizing that crop leaves the primary preview's alert ring pulsing with no
  visible stutter attributable to the crop, and the crop still drags and
  resizes smoothly.
- **Stuck-capture behavior after a lost mouse capture (`WM_CAPTURECHANGED`).**
  Neither prototype window handles that message, so a drag whose capture is
  taken away — a UAC prompt, Win+D, a lock screen, or another window
  grabbing capture mid-drag — may leave the crop or picker believing a drag
  is still in progress. The production gate: after capture is stolen
  mid-drag, the crop and picker return to a clean idle state (no phantom
  move/resize following the pointer, no drag that must be cancelled by
  clicking again), and the picker can still be confirmed or cancelled
  normally.

## Profiles (the EVE settings copier)

Named **EVE Settings** until it collided with the gear's own
"Settings". The route id is still `evesettings`, matching
evesettings.js and the `eve_settings_*` bridge methods.

The suite cannot exercise Windows file locking or a real `os.replace` retry,
so these are the checks that matter and only a Windows machine can run them.

- [ ] **Profiles opens with compact context and tools.** With a selected EVE
      profile, the full-width context row identifies the folder, server, and
      profile. The **Backups…** and **Edit formations…** sibling tool group
      sits directly beneath that context when the codec is available, without
      becoming another card or route. In Accounts mode, the Copy card contains
      **Identify accounts…**; none of these tools is an inline card below Copy.
- [ ] **Profile tools are named for what they are, not for who they seem
      scoped to.** Inspect the **Backups…** / **Edit formations…** tool
      group with a screen reader or the accessibility pane. Expected: its
      accessible name is `Profile tools` via `aria-labelledby`, not an
      `aria-label` claiming the group belongs only to the selected
      server/profile — `eve_settings_backup_dir()` is one fixed store, not
      scoped to that selection, so switching profiles must not change what
      the group's name implies it is showing.
- [ ] **Account identities are recognizable.** In Accounts mode, the summary
      reports the identified count. A named account leads with its username
      and retains its character summary and `Account <id>` secondarily; an
      unidentified account leads with `Account <id>` and says `Not identified`.
- [ ] **Missing discovery explains, rather than enables.** With no accounts,
      and separately with accounts but no characters, the appropriate guidance
      says what to launch/change/close. **Identify accounts…** is unavailable
      in both states.
- [ ] **Copy selection and completion stay local and legible.** Use **Select
      shown** and **Clear selection** after filtering. The commitment context
      precedes the roster and stays at the route's top while a long roster
      scrolls beneath it. It names the source, selected count, EVE state,
      automatic-backup policy, and Copy action without hiding any target. The
      copy button changes to the neutral `Copy operation in progress…` while
      busy, then global completion clears the
      selection and shows local `Copy complete.` with **View backups**.
      After the copy completes, select a target again and set a target filter,
      then follow that link and return with `‹ Profiles`. The source, target
      filter, selected target, and `Copy complete.` follow-up all survive the
      round trip. In Backups, set a backup filter and reveal older backups;
      leave and re-enter. Its filter is blank and pagination starts at the
      newest 20 entries on each entry.
- [ ] Choose the EVE folder. Servers and profiles populate; characters
      show names within a second or two of the route opening.
- [ ] **The folder card is one line on every visit after the first, and
      Profile is not part of it.** With a folder already chosen, open the
      route. Expected: `Profile` is its own always-visible row above the
      folder card, with `Copy profile…` beside it — present on every visit,
      never collapsed, because it is the control that changes, not setup.
      The EVE settings folder card below it is a single row — `Folder`, the
      path, the server (`Tranquility server`, round 5's R5 pattern) and a
      `Change folder or server…` button. Profile is not repeated here (round
      7's profile-first change): the folder card names only what rarely
      changes. Check the path still fits beside the server at the floor
      with the default EVE root. And the Copy EVE settings card's target
      list is on screen without scrolling. Press `Change folder or
      server…`: the folder and Server controls appear (Profile does not,
      it is never part of this face). Leave the route and come back: the
      folder card is one line again and Profile still shows above it. This
      is deliberate and not a bug — the collapse is what puts the task on
      screen, so it is not remembered.
- [ ] **Neither folder path can be clicked into.** Open the route with a
      folder chosen, then press `Change folder or server…`. Expected: the path in both faces
      of the card is monospace text on the card's own left edge, with no
      fill, no border and no focus ring — click it and nothing happens and
      nothing is focused. Compare it against Settings › Uploading, where the
      recording path in the same monospace face IS a text field you can
      type into: the two must not look alike. Drag the window to the floor
      with a deep root selected — the path ellipsises at its end and
      `Choose folder…` and `Detect` stay on the row.
- [ ] **`Copy from` is the widest control in its card.** With a folder
      chosen, look at the copy card. Expected: the `Copy from` dropdown
      spans the card's form measure — wider than the `Filter…` box below
      it, which shares its row with `Select all` and `Clear`. It decides
      what content overwrites every ticked character, and it used to be the
      narrowest control on the screen.
- [ ] **Selective copy groups follow the active kind.** Characters shows six
      groups, with only `Search history & suggestions` off by default. Accounts
      shows nine, with `Module slot layout` and `Search history & suggestions`
      off. Toggle one in each kind, switch back and forth, change the source,
      filter targets, and let a state refresh land; each kind keeps its choices.
- [ ] Copy with one or more groups unchecked. Each target keeps its own values
      for those groups while checked groups take the source values.
- [ ] Put an unknown key in the decoded source document and copy selectively.
      The unknown key travels to every target; selective copy must not discard
      settings it does not yet recognize.
- [ ] Include one target whose `.dat` cannot be decoded. The other targets still
      copy, and the result reports that target's failure rather than aborting the
      loop.
- [ ] Start EVE and attempt a selective copy. The copy is refused and every
      target file remains byte-for-byte intact.
- [ ] Restore an automatic backup made by selective copy. The target returns to
      its complete pre-copy state, including groups that were selected.
- [ ] Turn every group on and copy. The result matches a full structured copy;
      no recognized source setting is left behind.
- [ ] Remove the codec sidecar and reopen Profiles. `What to copy` is hidden,
      the existing Copy action remains available, and a copy uses the plain
      whole-file two-argument fallback.
- [ ] **Widening the window adds roster columns, not gutter.** With a folder
      chosen and a few dozen characters, put the window at the floor and note
      how many columns of names the target list has and where `Copy to
      selected` sits. Now drag the window much wider. Expected: the names
      reflow into MORE columns and the button climbs; the folder card above
      keeps its width and its left edge stays flush with the copy card's.
      Round 3's P10 measured the opposite — every extra pixel became margin,
      because Profiles wraps its route in the same `.settings` 620px wrapper
      the eight Settings sections use, so the roster inherited a measure meant
      for a label/field pair. D1 lifted the cap for the roster's card only:
      the prose, the `Copy from` row and the filter row are all still held to
      the old 586px measure on purpose, so a filter row narrower than the
      roster beneath it is correct here, not a bug.
- [ ] **The copy commit bar widens with the roster above the 840px floor,
      and only there.** With a folder chosen, put the window at its floor
      and note the commit bar (`Copy to selected`, its count, source, and
      the EVE pill) — it is capped to the card's ~586px prose measure
      alongside the rest of the setup controls. Drag the window past
      841px CSS width. Expected: the bar now spans the roster's full width
      below it, and the count and source sit grouped together rather than
      leaving a bare gap before the pill. Return to the floor (or measure
      at exactly 840px): the bar reverts to the capped layout — the
      widening is gated behind `min-width: 841px` and must not appear at
      or below it.
- [ ] **A folder that is not set, or cannot be read, opens the controls
      anyway.** Clear the folder (or point it at a directory you have no
      access to) and reopen the route. Expected: the full controls, not a
      summary of nothing, with the warning below them.
- [ ] **The EVE pill survives the collapse.** Start a client with the folder
      card collapsed. Expected: "EVE running" is showing at the right of the
      card's heading, in the pill's own case — not upper-cased and
      letter-spaced like the heading beside it. It is the warning for the
      copy below; it may not only appear when the card is expanded.
- [ ] **The settings-folder path is monospace and truncates.** Both faces of
      the card. Expected: the same monospace face as the webhook and the
      recordings folder, on the same label column as Server (Profile is its
      own always-visible row above the card, not part of either face), and
      a long root ends in an ellipsis rather than pushing `Change folder or
      server…` or
      `Choose folder…` toward the right edge. Check at 150% scaling, where
      the card is narrower than its own 620px.
- [ ] **The Characters / Accounts switch says what it is.** Expected:
      `Settings for` in the label column in front of the two radios, on the
      same column as `Copy from` below it. It was the only unlabelled
      control on the screen, and it changes what the source dropdown, the
      target list and the filter all mean. **The word is no longer `Copy`**
      (round 5's R3): that made four labels in one card say `Copy` with
      three different meanings, and this was the one whose options —
      `Characters`, `Accounts` — already say what they select. The label
      itself must still be there; an unlabelled switch is the defect the
      label was added for.
- [ ] Pull the network cable and reopen the route — characters render as
      `Character <id>`, nothing errors.
- [ ] **Identify accounts composes correctly at wide widths and keeps
      manual management subordinate.** Open `Identify accounts…` in a
      window past the floor. Expected: the guided flow's ~620px-capped
      column centres in the available width rather than sitting flush
      against the left edge. Below the guided flow, `Manage account names
      and character links…` is a single visibly and programmatically
      labelled disclosure group. Confirm with a screen reader or the
      accessibility pane that its name is `Manual management` and that the
      disclosure's own ids, copy, and behavior are otherwise unchanged.
- [ ] **Identify one account through a controlled client session.** Switch to
      Accounts and open `Identify accounts…`. Expected: a focused sub-screen,
      not a panel inserted into the copy card. Before anything starts it explains
      what Wingman will watch, and offers one primary action. The warning to
      close every EVE client sits immediately above **Begin identification**,
      where it remains visible before activation. A quiet `Step N of 5` line
      stays above the title and advances through Prepare, Watch for changes,
      Confirm character, Name account, and Review roster. Begin identification,
      launch one character, enter the game, make a small settings change, fully
      close that client, and press
      `Check changes`. Wingman proposes the one changed account and character
      and persists nothing when `Link character` opens the required account-name
      step.
- [ ] **No-change recovery names the required action.** Start identification but
      make no settings change before closing the client and checking. Expected:
      no link is proposed and the recovery copy explicitly says to make a small
      settings change in the client, close it completely, and check again. Do
      not substitute moving an in-game window for the settings change unless a
      separate live test has proved that it dirties both required files.
- [ ] **A pending match is disposable; the first save is atomic.** Select the
      proposed character, then leave with `‹ Profiles` before entering an account
      name. Return and verify neither the name nor the link was saved. Repeat the
      observation, enter the EVE Online username, and use `Save and continue`.
      Expected: the account name and first character link appear together, never
      one without the other. The page explains that the username stays on this
      computer.
- [ ] **Account names are unique without regard to case.** Identify or manually
      name a second account using only a case variation of the first account's
      username. Expected: Wingman refuses it inline with `That EVE Online
      username is already assigned to another account.` and changes neither
      account.
- [ ] **One-, two-, and three-character rosters can finish.** After the atomic
      first save, verify `1 of 3 characters linked`, activate `Done`, and verify
      the app returns to Profiles with the named account persisted with exactly
      that first character. Reopen identification for the same account, add a
      second character, verify `2 of 3`, activate `Done`, and verify Profiles
      shows exactly those two linked characters. Repeat for a third character:
      verify `3 of 3`, activate `Done`, and verify Profiles shows exactly all
      three linked characters. At three, neither the guided roster nor manual
      management offers a fourth character, and a stale direct request is
      refused.
- [ ] **An empty remaining roster explains recovery.** Use a profile with no
      other unlinked discovered character. Expected: the picker and `Add
      character` are hidden, `Done` is the single primary action, and the copy
      explains that only discovered characters can be offered and how to make a
      character available later.
- [ ] **Linked characters leave every Add dropdown.** Check both the guided
      roster and manual account management. Expected: a character linked to any
      account is absent, not offered as a move. Remove its existing link and
      verify it becomes available to add to another account.
- [ ] **Guided moves preserve the source on refusal.** Run identification for a
      character already linked to another named account. Expected: `WM.confirm`
      names both accounts before the move. Accept the confirmation, then verify
      the character is absent from the source account's roster and present in
      the destination account's roster. Repeat with a destination that already
      has three links. Expected: the move is refused and the character remains
      on its current account.
- [ ] **Identification supports repeated account work.** Re-identify an already
      named account and verify `Link character` skips the naming step. From a
      saved roster, choose `Identify another account`; it returns to the
      explanation without leaving the focused sub-screen, and a new start takes
      a fresh snapshot. The roster's `<named> of <discovered> accounts identified
      in this profile` progress updates from the current profile payload.
- [ ] **Names outlive every character link and EVE profile changes.** In `Manage
      account names and character links…`, remove every character from a named
      account. Expected: the name remains attached to its numeric account. Link
      characters again, switch between the Default and Alt EVE settings
      profiles, and return; names and confirmed links still follow the numeric
      account number.
- [ ] **Identification never guesses.** Repeat while two account clients are
      closed together. Expected: Wingman says more than one account changed and
      creates no association. Check once while EVE is still running too: it asks
      for the client to be closed rather than reading an incomplete write.
- [ ] **Identification and mutations exclude each other.** While the observation
      is active, Copy, backup Restore/Delete/Create, retention Apply, and
      formation editing are disabled and a direct stale click is refused. Then
      start a copy: `Identify accounts…` is disabled until it finishes. Leave
      the identity sub-screen with `‹ Profiles` during an observation and return:
      the observation was cancelled.
- [ ] **Cancelling a check in flight reads as idle, not a false no-changes
      message.** Start identification, launch a character, close it, then
      press `Check changes` and immediately press `‹ Profiles` (or `Cancel`)
      before the check would normally finish. Expected: the sub-screen
      returns to Prepare with no leftover "No account and character changes
      were found" text and no candidate offered — the cancelled check must
      not be mistaken for one that genuinely found nothing.
- [ ] **A deleted character retracts an offered candidate mid-flow.** Get
      Wingman to offer a candidate (`Check changes` reaches Confirm
      character), then, before confirming, have ESI/Wingman confirm that
      character deleted (e.g. the resolver's next pass on a known deleted
      ID). Expected: the candidate is withdrawn automatically, the
      sub-screen returns to Prepare, and the status line reads exactly
      `That character was deleted. Start account identification again.`
      rather than silently keeping a stale offer on screen.
- [ ] **Account identity controls are unavailable on a non-Tranquility
      folder.** Point the EVE folder at a Serenity, Singularity, or
      unrecognized shard directory. Expected: in Accounts mode, `Identify
      accounts…` and the account-tools row are hidden entirely (not merely
      disabled), account rows fall back to `Account <id>`, and copy/backup
      for that profile's characters and accounts remain fully available.
- [ ] **A deleted character may appear before ESI answers, then disappears.**
      Open Profiles with a known deleted local character file. Expected: the
      character may render in the list initially (before ESI resolves), then
      disappears once ESI confirms the deletion. The row stays hidden on
      subsequent refreshes in that process. After restart it may briefly
      reappear, then disappears once ESI reconfirms deletion.
- [ ] **Selected source or target disappearing leaves copy controls coherent.**
      Set up a copy with source and targets selected. During in-flight ESI
      resolution for deleted characters, remove a selected target from the
      roster (delete its `.dat` file). Expected: the Copy card remains usable,
      the selection updates, and completion succeeds for surviving targets
      without errors or corrupted state.
- [ ] **The deleted account link is absent after refresh and restart.**
      Identify and link a Tranquility character to an account, then confirm
      that character is deleted via ESI. Refresh the Profiles route and
      restart the app. Expected: the link is removed from Wingman's persisted
      account-character metadata; the account and other characters survive
      intact. Inspect `settings.json` to confirm the character ID is absent
      from `account_characters` for that account.
- [ ] **Active and unresolved characters remain usable.** With an active
      character, a character pending ESI resolution (network down), and a
      confirmed deleted character all in the same profile: Expected: active
      and unresolved characters remain visible, selectable, and copyable; only
      the confirmed-deleted row hides. The unresolved character persists
      across route refresh and Wingman restart.
- [ ] **The deleted character's local `.dat` and backup remain intact and
      listed.** After deletion filtering hides a character from Profiles and
      removes its account link, verify its `core_char_<id>.dat` file still
      exists in the profile folder unchanged. Open Backups and confirm the
      character's backup (if one exists) is still listed and restorable.
- [ ] **Switching profiles during in-flight resolution settles the latest
      profile.** Start resolution for profile A (Characters mode), switch to
      profile B while ESI requests are pending. Expected: profile A's in-flight
      pass finishes, then one coalesced trailing pass automatically resolves the
      latest selected profile without another user action; no deletion filtering
      or cleanup from stale passes mutate the current context.
- [ ] **A misleadingly named `tranquil*` directory remains untrusted and
      non-destructive.** Point the EVE folder at a directory named
      `tranquility_backup` or `fake_tranquility_other`. Expected: Profiles
      opens normally; character names use fallback resolution; no deletion
      filtering or account-link cleanup occurs, regardless of the directory
      name. In Accounts mode, identity controls remain unavailable. Copy and
      backup remain fully available.
- [ ] **Inspect every deterministic identity fixture in a browser.** Open
      `?dev=1&identity=<state>` for `idle`, `waiting`, `none`, `ambiguous`,
      `candidate-multiple`, `pending-name`, `existing-name`, `roster-one`,
      `roster-two`, `roster-three`, `roster-empty`, `move`, and `full`. Check
      every state at
      the 840x625 viewport floor and at a wider viewport. Expected: content fits,
      headings receive focus on step changes, each state has one primary action,
      inline errors remain associated with their field, and the roster count is
      announced as a live status.
- [ ] **Complete the real Windows/live-EVE pass before release.** Browser fixtures
      and automated tests do not prove that a real settings change dirties the
      required account and character files. On Windows with a live EVE install,
      execute the identification checks above end to end and verify the proposed
      IDs match the launched character and its account before treating this flow
      as operationally verified.
- [ ] **The roster reads alphabetically, down each column** (round 5's
      R1/D4). With a few dozen characters, look at the target list and the
      `Copy from` dropdown. Expected: both are in NAME order, not in the
      order of the ids in the filenames, and because the roster is a
      `columns` layout the names run A-Z down column one, then continue
      down column two. The order is applied where the names are
      (`Api.eve_settings_state`), not in `evesettings.tree`, which has only
      file ids — so check it again a second after the route opens, once the
      real names have replaced `Character <id>`: the roster re-sorts when
      they land, and that push is the only thing that can produce the
      finished order.
- [ ] Point the folder picker at a `settings_*` directory. The root heals
      upward and the tree still populates.
- [ ] Create a junction inside the EVE settings folder pointing outside it
      (`mklink /J <root>\junction C:\SomewhereElse`), then try to select it as
      a settings set. It must be refused as outside the configured folder --
      containment resolves symlinks and junctions, and this is the one path
      Linux CI cannot exercise.
- [ ] **Confirm Copy names both ends of the copy.** Select a source and one
      target and press Copy, then read the dialog before answering.
      Expected: the first line names the SOURCE character — "Copy Guarzo
      Opper's settings onto 1 other character?" — and the line under it
      names the target. Check the names match what the roster shows for
      those two rows (both come from `Api._eve_label`, so a disagreement
      means two producers have grown back). Then select more than six
      targets: the dialog names the first six and says "and N more" — the
      overflow must be stated, never a truncated list that reads as
      complete. Choose No.
- [ ] Copy one character onto three others with EVE closed. All three
      update; three auto-backups appear.
- [ ] Copy with EVE running. It fails with "The file is in use. Close EVE
      and retry", and every target is left intact.
- [ ] Restore the pre-copy backup for one character. The original settings
      come back.
- [ ] Back up a settings set, delete a `.dat` from it, restore. The deleted
      file returns.
- [ ] Add a file to a settings set that was not in its backup, then restore.
      It is removed, and the pre-restore auto-backup contains it.
- [ ] Restore with EVE running. Like a copy, it must fail rather than write
      -- restore stages every file and publishes with the same replace-with-
      retry, so a live client blocks it. The settings set must be left
      exactly as it was: nothing deleted, no `.tmp` files behind.
- [ ] Delete a settings set entirely, then restore its backup. The folder is
      recreated and the files come back.
- [ ] Start a copy and immediately try a second one. The second is refused
      with the busy message rather than interleaving.
- [ ] **The copy confirmation counts what you ticked.** Select two
      characters and press Copy. Expected: "Copy these settings onto 2
      other characters?" — not "2 other file(s)". Switch the mode to
      Accounts, select one, and confirm it reads "1 other account?" with
      no "(s)". The noun is derived from the selected files, so the dialog
      cannot disagree with the switch.
      **Then let the copy finish and read the status strip**: it must say
      "Copied to 2 characters.", not "2 file(s)". The two sentences are a
      second apart on the same screen and share one noun deliberately —
      fixing only the dialog would have made them disagree.
- [ ] **The copy confirmation repeats the running-client warning.** With an
      EVE client OPEN (the "EVE running" pill is showing), start a copy.
      Expected: the dialog itself says EVE is running and to close every
      client first, above the "cannot be undone" line. The pill is
      advisory and easy to miss; this dialog is modal and is the last
      thing before the write. Close every client and confirm the sentence
      disappears — it is probed fresh each time the dialog is raised, not
      read from the pill.

### Copy a whole profile (New/Replace)

The `Copy profile…` disclosure beside the primary Profile control
(`Api.eve_settings_copy_profile`, evesettings.js's `profileCopy` state)
creates a new `settings_*` folder from the selected profile, or replaces
another profile's files with a copy of it. Its deterministic branches are
covered by `tests/test_api_evesettings.py`, and the eleven
`?dev=1&profile=<key>` checkpoints in `wingman/web/dev.js`
(`tests/test_dev_harness.py`'s `PROFILE_COPY_SCENARIOS`) are a
REPRESENTATIVE set of rendered states, not an exhaustive one. Two outcomes
in particular have no checkpoint of their own: the UNKNOWN probe ("Wingman
could not verify that EVE is closed"), where only the RUNNING refusal and
the FAILED rollback are staged in `dev.js`, and a SUCCESSFUL rollback after
a caught publication failure. Both are covered in
`tests/test_api_evesettings.py`, and their rendered wording is proved only
by the manual checks below. This section is what only a Windows machine
with real `settings_*` folders can still prove.

- [ ] **Inspect every deterministic checkpoint in a browser first.** Open
      `?dev=1&profile=<key>` for `multiple`, `new-disclosure`,
      `replace-disclosure`, `invalid-name`, `collision`, `busy`, `created`,
      `replaced`, `eve-running`, `rollback-failed`, and `unsaved-selection`.
      Expected: each opens Profiles already showing its own state — the
      disclosure open in the right mode, the right inline error beside
      `Copy profile`, or the right settled outcome — without hand-driving
      the panel. Check `multiple` shows more than one profile with
      `Default` selected, so the Replace destination dropdown is not stuck
      on `No other profiles`.
- [ ] **No folder, one profile, multiple profiles, multiple servers.**
      With no EVE folder set, `Copy profile…` is unavailable (there is no
      selected profile to freeze as the source). With exactly one profile,
      `New profile` is the only usable mode — `Replace existing` offers
      no destination. Add a second profile, and separately a second server
      with its own profiles: the Replace destination list is always the
      OTHER profiles on the currently selected server, never a profile
      that belongs to a different one.
- [ ] **Root, server, and profile picks show canonical context before the
      disclosure opens.** Point the folder picker at a `settings_*`
      directory or a legacy deep root and let it heal upward. Change server
      and profile. Expected: `Copy profile…` opens against the canonical
      profile actually selected, and `Copying` inside the panel names that
      profile — never a stale or pre-canonicalization path.
- [ ] **Route re-entry and keyboard-only use of the disclosure.** Open
      `Copy profile…`, then leave Profiles for another route (Backups,
      Settings, Skills) and come back. Expected: the disclosure is closed —
      it is not remembered across a visit, the same rule the folder card's
      own collapse follows. Reopen it and drive the whole flow — mode
      radios, Name, Replace, Copy profile, Cancel — using only Tab, Space,
      and Enter; nothing requires a pointer, the order through the panel is
      the order it reads in, and every control in it is reachable. Tabbing
      on past Cancel continues into the rest of the route, as it should —
      this is an inline disclosure, not a modal, so focus is not trapped.
- [ ] **Create success, and the created profile is visible everywhere it
      should be.** With EVE closed, open `New profile`, type a name, and
      press `Copy profile`. Expected: the button reads a neutral busy state
      while the copy runs, the disclosure closes on completion, and the new
      profile is now selected in the primary Profile control. Launch EVE's
      own launcher/client and confirm the created `settings_*` profile is
      visible there as a distinct profile, not merged into an existing one.
- [ ] **Replace: confirm, decline, the backup, and the retained source.**
      With EVE closed, open `Replace existing`, choose another profile as
      the destination, and press `Copy profile`. Expected: a destructive
      confirmation names both the source and the destination profile and
      states that the destination is backed up first. Decline it once —
      nothing in the destination changes and no backup is taken. Accept it
      once — Backups gains a fresh automatic backup of the destination
      taken before the replace, the destination's files now match the
      source, and the SOURCE remains the selected profile throughout;
      replacing a profile never moves the selection onto the one just
      replaced.
- [ ] **Running and unknown EVE both refuse the copy.** With an EVE client
      open, attempt both `New profile` and `Replace existing`. Expected:
      the copy is refused with "EVE is running. Close EVE and retry."
      beside `Copy profile`, and nothing on disk changes. Separately, with
      EVE closed but its process state impossible for Wingman to confirm
      (for example, a permissions-restricted process list), expect the
      "Wingman could not verify that EVE is closed" refusal instead of a
      guess in either direction. For Replace specifically, start EVE
      AFTER accepting the confirmation dialog but before the copy runs:
      the second, later probe must still catch it and refuse.
- [ ] **Created-but-selection-unsaved warning.** Make the settings file
      that stores the EVE folder selection briefly unwritable (read-only,
      or the containing directory locked), then create a new profile.
      Expected: the profile exists on disk and the Profile dropdown offers
      it, but the warning explains Wingman could not remember the
      selection and to select it manually — never a plain "failed" that
      would invite retrying a creation that already happened.
- [ ] **A caught publication failure recovers from its own backup, and a
      failed rollback still names the way back.** For Replace, interrupt
      the copy partway (for example, revoke write access to one file
      inside the destination profile mid-copy) so publication raises after
      writing some but not all files. Expected: Wingman restores the
      destination from the automatic backup it took moments before, reports
      the destination is unchanged, and leaves no partial write behind.
      Separately, make that same restore itself fail (for example, revoke
      read access to the backup archive). Expected: the message names the
      destination as possibly holding a mix of both profiles and names the
      specific backup archive to restore from Backups by hand — the
      archive is now the only way back, and this is an instruction, not an
      error code.
- [ ] **The hard-kill boundary relies on Backups, not on rollback.** Kill
      Wingman's process (not EVE's) mid-replace, after the destructive
      confirmation but before the worker finishes. Expected: on relaunch,
      the destination profile may be left partially written with no
      automatic rollback attempted — recovery is restoring the automatic
      backup taken just before the replace from **Backups**, which is
      exactly why that backup is unconditional and taken before a single
      file changes.
- [ ] **A real Windows junction inside the EVE settings folder is refused
      as a copy source or destination**, the same as it already is for a
      selective copy target (see the junction check above): create one
      beside the real profiles, INSIDE the selected server rather than at
      the canonical root — `mklink /J <root>\<server>\settings_Escape
      C:\SomewhereElse` — so that it is offered as a profile at all; a
      junction at the root is not a profile and the copy would never look
      at it. Then exercise it both ways. As DESTINATION: `Replace existing`
      against it, and `New profile` typing a name that would collide with
      it. As SOURCE: select `Escape` in the primary Profile control and
      run both `New profile` and `Replace existing` from it. Nothing
      publishes through the junction in either direction; the escape is
      refused before anything is staged, and `C:\SomewhereElse` is
      untouched afterwards.
- [ ] **840×625 at 100% and 200% scaling.** At the CSS viewport floor, open
      `Copy profile…` in both modes. Expected: the panel, its radios, the
      Name/Replace fields, and both buttons fit without horizontal
      scrolling, and the inline error message wraps rather than truncating.
      Repeat at 200% Windows scaling — the disclosure is still fully
      reachable and legible, and the primary Profile row does not crowd
      `Copy profile…` off the row's right edge.

### Backups

- [ ] Open **Backups** from Profiles and verify an empty history, an unreadable
      backup directory, a matching filter, a no-match filtered state, and the
      cleared-filter state each say the right thing. While a Profiles mutation
      is pending, filtering, disclosure navigation, route exit, and `Show 20
      older backups` remain usable while Restore, Delete, manual backup, and
      retention Apply remain disabled.
- [ ] **The manager has one route scrollbar.** At 840×625 and at wide widths,
      its history scrolls with the route rather than an inner list. `Show 20
      older backups` reveals the next batch without reordering rows, and the
      target column retains enough human identity to choose a restore.
- [ ] **Restore is visible; Delete is disclosed.** Each row exposes Restore and
      a keyboard-accessible More disclosure for its single Delete action; Delete
      retains danger treatment. Opening one disclosure closes any other without
      moving focus. Escape closes the current disclosure and returns focus to
      its More control. Scroll to the final row and open More: its menu opens
      upward, wholly inside the route rather than being cut by the bottom edge.
- [ ] **Retention is explicit and protects manual backups.** The collapsed
      Retention summary shows a chevron, rotates it when opened, and remains
      keyboard-operable through the native disclosure. With `auto_keep`
      at ten, eleven copies of one target retain the newest ten automatic
      backups, while manual backups remain. Lower it to 3 and Apply: the
      confirmation states the exact automatic-backup deletions. Decline leaves
      value and files unchanged; accept removes only excess automatic backups.
      Eleven different targets prune nothing because retention is per item.
- [ ] **The profile backup action names its object.** Switch between Default and
      Alt. Expected: the button reads `Back up Default profile` and `Back up Alt
      profile`; with no profile selected it reads `Back up profile` and is
      disabled.
- [ ] **Backups' Origin column aligns with the target's name, not its id.**
      Open Backups with a mixed history of automatic and manual entries.
      Expected: each row's `.es-backup-grid` aligns to the row's start, so
      Origin sits level with the target's name line rather than between
      the name and its raw id beneath it. Origin's text reads in a
      distinct, slightly dimmer colour than Date — not the same faint
      colour the target's own secondary (raw id) line uses — so the two
      read as separate columns; Origin still names only Automatic or
      Manual, nothing else.
- [ ] Check the packaged build: Profiles and Backups open, and the folder picker
      opens.

## Overview and layout sharing (Profiles → Share setup… / Import setup…)

**Current Task 11 engineering evidence:** Linux native/Node tests and an isolated
Chromium rerun cover the corrected native warnings and detached Create outcomes
at 840x625 and 839x621. See the [current checkpoint](overview-layout-sharing-verification.md).
All actual Windows/EVE/launcher checks below remain OPEN; no new operator actions
were requested or performed for that engineering pass.

**Operator-authorized manual gates, not automated test results.** Use disposable
profiles and dedicated test pairs; obtain separate account-owner
permission before any live EVE or launcher action. Do not use a sender clone as
an independent recipient. Do not edit original profiles, private captures or
hardware files to make a test pass. Record platform, build/codec hashes, actual
results and any refusal in the
[overview/layout verification record](overview-layout-sharing-verification.md).
Linux codec tests and developer-browser evidence do not close these Windows/EVE
gates. Wingman must never move or resize a running EVE client.

### Bundled complete-setup library

Content admission for Iridium — Wingman layout and Z-S — Wingman layout is
recorded in [the hash-bound content reference](reference/curated-preset-content.md).
This is not a packaged WebView2 or live-EVE pass. The following remain open;
content redistribution approval does not authorize installation or live-profile
operations. Apply the operator-authorization boundaries above.

- [ ] **Source → Recipient → Review → Create.** In Profiles → Import setup…,
      choose **Bundled setup…** and select each admitted full setup. Confirm only
      its description and 3840×2160/150% display context are shown, including that
      positions are copied as saved, not fitted. Source URLs, revision, author,
      licence and validation evidence belong in the repository reference and
      shipped notices, not this page. **Use setup** fills the draft without writing
      a profile; only Review then Create can publish. Cancel/close browsing and
      failed entry loads preserve the existing draft/review.
- [ ] **Source selection and text editing.** Entry shows three source choices,
      not an empty textarea. Loading a file or bundled setup shows a compact
      source summary; **Edit text** reveals its input, **Done editing** hides it.
      **Change source** and **Keep current source** preserve the draft until a
      replacement is accepted. Clipboard denial reveals a focused manual-paste
      field. Cancelling a pending source choice prevents its late response from
      replacing the current source. Check these paths with a populated name and
      recipient as well as an empty draft.
- [ ] **Blockers, identity and keyboard exits.** Missing source, name, account
      and incompatible recipient/account each explain the actual blocker. The
      account hint exposes the full confirmed identity when the select elides it.
      Refresh base sits with the base selector. Review owns the accent during
      preparation; Create owns it only after a valid review. With the bundled
      picker open, Escape closes only that picker and restores focus to its
      opener, preserving text, name, recipient and review. Escape in a replacement
      confirmation still belongs to that confirmation. Check at 840×625 and
      839×621 CSS pixels and a larger window, including long names and errors.
- [ ] **Actual complete arrangements.** Import each preset onto an independently
      initialized disposable recipient, not a sender clone. Record the selected
      ID/revision/SHA-256 and actual build/platform. Check the intended groups,
      all ordered labels/formatting and supported saved windows against the
      artifact, not just the summary. Check recipient preferences before launch
      and after an authorized reload separately. Geometry references remain
      2560×1440 as saved; catalog 4K/150% metadata must not rescale coordinates or
      change local resolution/UI scale. Leave gameplay suitability unclaimed.
- [ ] **Independent copies.** A subsequent library revision changes available
      choices only; an already imported profile is not modified. Browsing needs
      no catalog network request and no EVE-closed permission. Create still needs
      a fresh review and confirmed closed EVE; stale recipients refuse.
- [ ] **Frozen content and notices.** On an authorized packaged build, both
      complete presets load through the picker. Compare actual
      `_internal/assets/setup-presets/` manifest, derived artifact filenames and
      licence files with the source byte inventory. Read the Iridium MIT and Z-S
      GPLv3 notices, including contributor-attestation limitations. A successful
      build inventory gate alone does not prove WebView2 loading or game reload.
- [ ] **Community admission.** A proposed addition supplies a complete portable
      export, approved arrangement/credit/display context, privacy review,
      original-source attribution and redistribution evidence. Bind admission to
      exact bytes/hash and test against a distinct recipient. Record whether
      evidence was independently inspected or attested; do not invent permission,
      gameplay validation, a second fixture preset, or a publishing UI.

### Existing import/export safety and runtime gates

- [ ] **Fresh independent base.** With operator approval, normally initialize a
      disposable recipient through EVE, then close every client. Confirm the
      base has its own account/character DATs, `core_public__.yaml` and `prefs.ini`,
      and a confirmed account–character association in Wingman. Keep an untouched
      baseline and perform a no-change launch/close control before testing import.
      Record distinctly different sender/recipient filters, labels, local display
      preferences and unrelated settings. A missing display file must refuse
      Review; neither the artifact nor a sender copy may supply it.
- [ ] **Closed means positively confirmed.** Share, Review and Create refuse when
      EVE is running or the process check is UNKNOWN/unavailable. Begin a review
      with EVE closed, then start a disposable client before Create: creation must
      refuse without changing existing profiles. Close the client and re-review.
- [ ] **Export is a snapshot.** Select one local source pair with a confirmed
      association. Share includes effective unsaved filter overrides without
      modifying source DATs. Inspect a synthetic exported JSON: no DAT envelope,
      paths, account/character IDs, CRC, revisions, local timestamps/history or
      hardware preferences. User-authored names/markup are text, not anonymized;
      do not distribute a personal export under an anonymity assumption.
- [ ] **Alternate recipient is independent.** While Profiles selects the source,
      browse a different initialized base in Import. Choose its own character and
      confirmed account, not the source pair. Browsing/Review must not persist the
      ordinary Profiles selection or create a directory. Review identifies that
      base/pair, new name, account-wide effects, imported scope and retained local
      display settings. Editing any input invalidates Create until a new Review.
- [ ] **New-only publication.** An existing name, including a case-only spelling,
      is refused; no replacement or merge is offered. Create publishes a new
      complete sibling profile, reports its actual path and consumes the review
      once. Repeated Create must not publish twice. Source/base files stay byte
      identical. Unselected recognized DATs copy unchanged; unrelated cache files
      do not become settings files. No partial visible profile survives a failure.
- [ ] **Display preservation before launch.** Compare the new profile's
      `core_public__.yaml` and `prefs.ini` byte-for-byte with the recipient baseline
      before launching EVE. Never take these files from the sender. After the
      authorized recipient launch, verify local resolution, display mode, monitor
      choice and UI scaling remain recipient-local; record any EVE rewrite
      separately from Wingman's pre-launch byte preservation.
- [ ] **Launcher discovery and activation.** Only after successful publication,
      the operator restarts the launcher and explicitly selects the newly named
      profile for the recipient. Wingman's success/selection is not launcher
      activation. Record whether the launcher discovers the new profile and
      confirm the launched pair is the recipient before judging visual results.
- [ ] **Supported saved layout, not auto-fit.** Compare supported unstacked windows
      against the reviewed snapshot: active overview groups, Selected item, Probe
      scanner, Directional scanner, Drones, Fleet, Watch list, Standalone bookmarks,
      Solar-system map and Primary map where supported. Check each supplied open,
      minimized, collapsed, compact, locked, overlay and light-background override,
      target origin/lock and HUD offset. Saved geometry/reference sizes are copied
      as-is, including negative positions; a different recipient display is not
      silently fitted or resized. Unsupported shapes must refuse, not be clamped.
- [ ] **Groups, filters and labels.** Exercise the synthetic eight-tab/three-group
      setup and all nine ordered label records, including repeated null types,
      markup, disabled entries and optional formatting. Check actual EVE label
      appearance/order after reload, group membership and effective filter bodies.
      Recipient-local filters/overrides not imported remain; imported stale
      overrides must not shadow the new bodies. Check tab selection reset and
      retirement of surplus overview instances without deleting unrelated windows.
- [ ] **Affected stacks refuse.** Test stacked sender/recipient supported windows,
      including a surplus recipient overview that import would retire. Refuse with
      actionable context and unchanged files. An unrelated private chat stack is
      retained; do not unstack or delete caches automatically to bypass a refusal.
- [ ] **Native YAML is configuration-only.** Import the synthetic native YAML.
      Ambiguous labels must require an explicit, initially unchecked **Keep my
      ship labels**, then another Review. Use a recipient label sequence with
      different order, multiplicity and text from both the sender and YAML; check
      it survives intact. Supplied tabs form one primary group; surplus instances
      close but saved recipient geometry/HUD/target origin do not import from YAML.
      Omitted options retain local values; supplied aggregates replace. Do not
      describe this as an exact reproduction of EVE's native import/reset logic.
- [ ] **Errors and recovery.** On disposable test data, change an unselected DAT
      or preference file after Review (include a same-size edit), or create the
      destination externally. Create must refuse stale authority/collision without
      overwriting the external change. Exercise a controlled copy/encode/publication
      failure in a test build: no partial profile, context remains useful, and a
      fresh Review works. A publication with failed selection persistence still
      reports the created path and warning, not a retryable failed publication.
- [ ] **Create then Back.** Leave while creation is pending; after the initial
      Profiles read completes, its eventual success, failure or publication warning
      must appear beside the setup tools. Profiles refreshes authoritative state;
      it must not blindly select the completion path or force a return from another
      screen. Reopening Import must start with empty private input. An older setup
      completion cannot change a newer review/Create or settle an ordinary copy.
      Native review messages appear once, with warning emphasis retained.
- [ ] **Windows/WebView2 and frozen app.** Use the installed artifact, not source
      Python. Import both Wingman JSON and native YAML through Paste and Choose
      file; export through Copy and Save. Confirm PyYAML loads without a missing
      module/extension error and the codec runs without console flashes. Exercise
      UTF-8/non-ASCII file paths, clipboard denial, dialog cancellation, Tab/Space/
      Enter/Escape, text-only markup, pending creation/Back and return focus. At
      100%, 125%, 150% and 200% scaling, verify the 840x625 logical floor: no
      horizontal overflow, readable scrolling review and visible pinned actions.
      Inspect the packaged PyYAML MIT notice. The build's archive/extension check
      is necessary but does not substitute for this runtime exercise.

## Probe formations (Profiles → Edit formations…)

Needs a real install for the write lines; the editor itself states the
close-EVE requirement beside Save. Use prepared copies/backups of two unrelated
accounts, with every EVE client closed before each save or restore. Do not run
against live profiles without the account owner's authorization. Record actual
results and platform separately in
[the sharing verification record](history/probe-formation-sharing-verification.md): a
Linux developer-browser pass is not a Windows/WebView2, OS clipboard, or live-EVE
pass.

- [ ] The **Edit formations…** tool is present when the codec is bundled and
      absent (not broken) when `bin/wingman-settings-codec.exe` is removed from
      the install; Copy and Backups still work in both cases.
- [ ] **The editor starts on the intended account and switches cleanly.** Open
      from Characters mode and from Accounts mode: the initial account follows
      the stated choice, its canonical account label is selected, and its
      formations load. With no edits, switch to another account and verify its
      own formations replace the first account's data. In `?dev=1&formations-account=switch`,
      wait for the fixture's 150 ms formation-read delay before judging the
      replacement; the delay deliberately exposes the asynchronous switch path.
- [ ] **Dirty and failed account changes preserve visible work.** Make an edit,
      choose another account, decline the discard confirmation, and verify the
      original account and edit remain selected. Accept on a later attempt and
      verify the requested account loads. Use a damaged account file both on
      entry and while switching: failed entry returns to Profiles with the
      reason, while a failed switch retains the current account and its edits.
- [ ] **Last formation account is session-only.** After a successful switch,
      leave and reopen the editor in the same session: it reopens that account.
      Restart Wingman and verify no formation-account choice was persisted.
- [ ] Open an account with a formation created in-game: it lists with the right name and probe count; ranges read as AU powers of two.
- [ ] **Version gate:** Save with no edits, then launch the client on that account. UI layout, overview, and the formation are all intact. (The client writes version 0; Wingman writes version 1. Proven once on 2026-08-29 — design doc finding 10 — and re-walked here so a client update that changes the answer is caught before a user meets it.)
- [ ] Edit a formation, save, launch the client: the probe scanner shows the edit; the client's selected formation is unchanged.
- [ ] Save with a client running: refused with "The file is in use. Close EVE and retry."; file bytes unchanged.
- [ ] Restore the pre-edit auto backup from the Backups manager: the old formation returns.
- [ ] Reorder by deleting and re-adding: the client's selected formation still points at the same formation, not the same slot.
- [ ] Save a formation in Wingman, edit it in the client (move a probe, rename), close the client, reopen in Wingman: the client's edit is what Wingman shows, and Save then round-trips it again.
- [ ] Open an account whose file the parser refuses (only reproducible with a hand-damaged copy): the editor does not open, the reason is shown, and the file is untouched.
- [ ] Delete every formation, save, launch the client: the probe scanner has no custom formations and nothing else about the client's settings changed. (An empty list is a real state, not a failed save — this is the line that proves write does not confuse the two.)
- [ ] With unsaved edits showing, the title bar offers no other destination and the gear is hidden: `‹ Profiles` is the only way out and it asks before discarding. (Every other exit routed away without asking, and the next open silently loaded over the edits.)

### Portable formation sharing and stale-file recovery

- [ ] **Copy is a draft snapshot, not a save.** Edit a name, position, and range;
      select sharing checkboxes independently of the currently open row. Copy
      includes only the selected current drafts in meters (including unsaved
      changes), without local IDs, account paths, scratch entries or selection
      state. It leaves all edits/checkboxes intact and writes no account file or
      backup. Names are user-authored text, not anonymized. With no selection,
      Copy is disabled; an invalid unselected formation must not prevent Copy.
- [ ] **Native blur/click and keyboard selection.** While typing a new name,
      click its sharing checkbox: it toggles once, not zero times. Repeat with
      mouse deselection and Tab/Space. The renamed label updates without losing
      checkbox/button identity or focus. Test unblurred coordinate input too.
- [ ] **Clipboard denial is visible.** Deny clipboard write permission, then Copy.
      No success message appears, the draft remains editable, and retry works
      after permission is restored. Test unavailable clipboard API and rejected
      writes in the developer browser; separately test actual Windows clipboard
      permission behavior and receiving pasted text. No automatic clipboard read
      occurs on opening Paste or the editor.
- [ ] **Paste/Review never inserts or saves.** Open Paste; the shared-text field
      receives focus. Paste valid text and choose Review: names, probe counts
      and previews appear separately from the draft, with ordinary Save hidden/disabled.
      Review a one-probe and a two-probe formation together: the differing counts
      are visible and included in each editable name's screen-reader label.
      Only explicit **Add formations** appends the entire validated batch and
      focuses its first row. Only subsequent **Save formations** writes the file.
- [ ] **Invalid text is recoverable.** Try malformed JSON, duplicate JSON keys,
      unsupported version/type, deeply nested text, more than 64 KiB of UTF-8
      (including multibyte names), invalid numeric types and out-of-bounds ranges
      or coordinates. Errors remain visible; no partial candidates are inserted,
      no text is silently clipped, and corrected text can be reviewed normally.
- [ ] **Batch/name boundaries and Unicode conflicts.** Review 1 and 32 formations;
      reject 0 and 33. Accept 128 Unicode code points (including supplementary
      characters), reject 129, empty/control-character names, and duplicates.
      Existing `STRASSE` conflicts with incoming `Straße`; Python decides all
      conflicts. Rename conflicting candidates explicitly: no replacement,
      skipping or automatic rename. Recheck all names on Add, including a new
      collision introduced after Review. Markup-shaped names render only as text.
- [ ] **Cancel preserves work.** With an unsaved draft, sharing ticks and edited
      fields, open Paste, review/rename, then Cancel. No rows were added, no file
      or backup changed, the ordinary draft is intact, and focus returns to Paste.
      Cancel while validation is pending; its late reply must not insert anything.
- [ ] **Empty destination and recipient identity.** Add to an account with no user
      formations; Save assigns nonnegative local IDs. Add to another account with
      existing formations and scratch entries: existing IDs, unrelated settings
      and a valid selected formation remain intact; incoming IDs are freshly
      allocated above that recipient's nonnegative IDs, not copied from the sender.
- [ ] **Stale-file recovery is explicit.** Load a prepared account copy, edit it in
      Wingman, then alter that copy externally before Save. Save refuses it and
      leaves external bytes and the unsaved draft intact. Copy the draft to keep
      **before** Reload, cancel Reload once, then confirm it and Paste/Review/Add
      the saved text back, resolving names explicitly. No force-save or automatic
      merge is offered. Keep EVE closed and stop external edits while saving:
      conflict checks are optimistic, not an atomic compare-and-swap.
- [ ] **Edits during Save and reload survive.** Make a newer edit (including an
      unblurred name or partial coordinate) while Save runs, and separately while
      its reread runs. It remains dirty and visible; the next Save uses the last
      committed content revision, not an ignored reread's revision. Delayed replies
      after an account change, cancellation or leaving/reopening cannot alter the
      current draft, copy status or baseline. Repeated Add/Save must not duplicate
      insertion or let an older completion unlock the newer operation.
- [ ] **Delete cannot retarget a stale confirmation.** With a delayed Reload or
      post-save reread pending, open Delete for A, then let the read replace A with
      B at the same index. Confirming the old dialog must leave B and the rest of
      the list unchanged and say nothing was deleted; choose Delete again to act
      on B. Repeat with reused local IDs/names. In the developer browser, inject
      a route exit/reopen or selection change while the dialog is open: an old
      Yes must not delete the new selection/session's data. Ordinary confirmed
      deletion while Save runs remains a live unsaved edit, not an implicit save.
- [ ] **Save failure and post-save warning differ.** EVE-running/probe failure,
      backup failure or codec refusal means no publication. A successfully
      published save followed by a retention/status failure still reports success
      with its committed revision; warning feedback must not invite duplicate
      saves. Confirm the saved bytes and the pre-save backup independently.
- [ ] **Fractional geometry and restoration in EVE.** Export from account A, import
      into unrelated B, Save with all clients closed, then launch B. Check actual
      probe positions/ranges and selected formation, and that A is unchanged.
      Repeat a save/reload/export cycle: sharing does not normalize fractional
      ranges; ordinary editor reload retains its six-decimal-AU normalization.
      Close every client, restore B's pre-save backup through Backups, launch to
      confirm restoration, then close it. Synthetic codec tests do not certify
      EVE accepts the document or every supported range.
- [ ] **Viewport, keyboard and accessibility.** At 840×625 and the 839×621 stress
      size, check ordinary and review panes, 32 long-name rows, empty/error states,
      and long stale-file warnings. Scroll content without losing Review/Add/Cancel
      or Save/Reload, and check no horizontal clipping. At Windows 100/125/150/200%
      scaling repeat the logical-pixel floor checks. Tab/Shift-Tab/Enter/Space can
      complete Copy, Paste, Review, rename, Add, Cancel and recovery. Check screen
      reader names for sharing checkboxes, editable names, geometry, previews,
      conflicts and live statuses; focus remains visible and is restored after
      Cancel/Add. Save remains the only accent action and there is no new title-bar
      destination.

## EVE Fittings

These checks require a real Windows/WebView2 install and, where stated, a live
EVE character. The registered EVE application used for the pass must accept the
same full authorization set declared in `wingman/eveauth/application.py`:
`esi-fittings.read_fittings.v1`, `esi-fittings.write_fittings.v1`,
`esi-skills.read_skills.v1`, and `esi-skills.read_skillqueue.v1`. The `?dev=1`
harness is useful for visual states, but it does not verify consent, ESI reads,
ESI writes, DPAPI, cache behavior, or restart durability and cannot substitute
for these items.

### Migration and centralized authorization

- [ ] **A pre-feature Skills document migrates without losing Skills.** Start
      from a real `eve_skills.json` made by the last release before shared EVE
      authority, with at least one working two-scope Skills grant. Keep copies
      of the primary and `.bak`, launch once, and inspect
      `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FlyGD Wingman\`. Expected: `eve_authority.json` now owns
      identity/scopes/credential; `eve_skills.json` retains plans, groups,
      levels, queue and ETags but no credential fields; Skills refresh still
      succeeds for that character. Restart and refresh Skills again. A migration
      that only paints the old result while the token is unusable is a failure.
- [ ] **A failed migration is fail-closed and resumable.** With both the legacy
      primary and backup unreadable or corrupt, launch. Expected: an actionable
      unavailable state, the evidence files preserved, and NEITHER a new empty
      authority document nor a migration-complete marker. Restore one valid
      source and relaunch; migration then completes. Never infer absence from an
      access error.
- [ ] **Settings > Characters is the only EVE authorization surface.** Open
      Skills and Fittings and follow any authorize/reconnect/forget handoff.
      Expected: the write happens in Settings > Characters, and the
      authorization card says EVE sign-in adds a character or updates access
      for Skills and Fittings. Neither destination nor the roster exposes a
      per-row or per-feature authorization button.
- [ ] **An older two-scope Skills grant stays scoped until reconnected.** Start
      from a migrated or existing grant that has only `esi-skills.read_skills.v1`
      and `esi-skills.read_skillqueue.v1`. Refresh it in Skills successfully,
      then open Settings > Characters and Fittings. Expected: Skills reads as
      Authorized, Fittings reads as Access needed, no fitting GET occurs before
      reconnect, and no fitting scopes were silently added to the existing
      grant.
- [ ] **Settings > Characters requests exactly the full four-scope set.** Start
      authorization or reconnect from Settings > Characters. The EVE consent
      page requests `esi-fittings.read_fittings.v1`,
      `esi-fittings.write_fittings.v1`, `esi-skills.read_skills.v1`, and
      `esi-skills.read_skillqueue.v1`, with no additional Wingman scopes.
      Completing the flow with any EVE character is evaluated by the returned
      identity and cleanup/owner checks below.
- [ ] **A returned unknown character is accepted only after cleanup is verified.**
      Start sign-in from Settings > Characters and choose a character not
      currently in Wingman's authority roster. Expected: Wingman adds it when
      both Skills and Fittings cleanup verification report no orphan state for
      that character ID. If either required cleanup slot is unavailable or
      reports that ID blocked, the sign-in is refused and authority state is
      unchanged.
- [ ] **A known unequal owner is refused without mutation.** Start sign-in from
      Settings > Characters for a character Wingman already knows, using a
      controlled setup that can return a different known owner hash for the same
      character ID. Expected: the sign-in is refused with a forget-first
      instruction, the previous grant and feature snapshots remain, and no
      cleanup runs. If either owner hash is absent, the validated character-ID
      match remains compatible and preserves or records the non-empty owner.
- [ ] **Cancel and callback races resolve deterministically.** Start sign-in
      from Settings > Characters and exercise both orders once. Expected: if
      you cancel before EVE replies, the cancellation wins. If EVE replies
      first, that reply wins and the later cancel is ignored.
- [ ] **Partial cleanup blocks re-add until reconciliation.** Produce a
      cleanup-save failure after forgetting a character from Settings >
      Characters. Expected: the row is gone, the warning explains that some
      cleanup was not saved, and Wingman refuses to add that character back
      until reconciliation proves what survived.
- [ ] **50-row keyboard/menu checks.** With deterministic staging or an
      equivalent large live roster, open Settings > Characters at the
      840x625 floor. Expected: authorization remains in its compact card, the
      Character access card uses the remaining pane width and height, the
      roster scrolls internally, the last visible row's More menu opens by
      mouse and keyboard, Escape closes it, focus returns to the trigger, and
      no horizontal or outer-pane overflow appears.

### Library, import and curation

- [ ] **A real Personal Fittings read imports atomically.** Put representative
      fits on the enabled character, including racks, cargo/drones, charges or
      scripts, and one fit with the schema-defined `Invalid` row if available.
      Press Refresh. Expected: a complete successful read updates the library;
      a deliberately interrupted/failed read keeps prior entries and presence
      visible as stale rather than clearing them.
- [ ] **Equivalent fits deduplicate by loadout, not name or numbered slot.** Put
      equivalent fits on two characters with different names and high/medium/
      low slot numbering. Refresh both. Expected: one library entry, both source
      aliases retained, and both character presences shown. Change a meaningful
      quantity, rack, cargo, drone, charge or script and confirm it imports as a
      distinct entry.
- [ ] **Recent import and source-character filtering identify new presence.**
      Refresh a character with one newly copied Personal Fitting whose loadout
      already exists in the library. Filter to that refresh and source
      character. Expected: the existing consolidated entry appears because its
      NEW presence carries the refresh batch/time; filtering does not depend on
      the older library entry's creation date. Clear each filter and confirm the
      full collection returns.
- [ ] **Alliance ingestion uses Personal Fittings and stays explicit.** In EVE,
      copy several alliance fits into one character's Personal Fittings. Refresh
      that character, isolate the recent/source results, select them, and add
      them to an `Alliance` collection. Expected: only the entries you chose are
      filed; Wingman neither reads a corporation/alliance endpoint nor assumes
      every fit on that character is an alliance fit.
- [ ] **Unfiled, Superseded and custom collections are durable views.** Add one
      fitting to two custom collections, rename one collection, remove one
      membership, and mark an older same-hull entry superseded by a newer one.
      Expected: Unfiled is derived correctly, Superseded contains the older fit,
      collection deletion removes grouping only, and no character fitting or
      library entry is deleted. Restart after EACH mutation and verify exactly
      the committed state returns.
- [ ] **Expanded detail is complete and safe.** Open a fit with aliases and more
      than one presence. Expected: one row expanded at a time; racks, cargo,
      drones/fighters, quantities, preferred description, aliases, character
      names/source names, seen dates, collection membership and supersession are
      readable. Editing name/description commits only from Save, never blur.
      Text from EVE renders as text, not markup.
- [ ] **`Invalid` content remains visible but cannot deploy.** An imported fit
      containing the schema-defined `Invalid` flag stays in the library and its
      detail labels that group **Invalid (not deployable)**. It is classified
      Unavailable in copy preflight and no POST is made for it.
- [ ] **Paging, keyboard and overlays work in WebView2.** Exercise more than 100
      entries, search, ship filter, every collection, next/previous page, row
      checks and one expanded detail. Selection never leaks to another page or
      filter. Tab through Characters and Copy overlays, verify a visible focus
      ring, Escape closes when safe, and no browser-native confirm/prompt/alert
      appears.

### Explicit additive copy

- [ ] **Preflight names every classification and exact cost.** Build one batch
      containing Ready, Already present (equivalent content under any name),
      Name conflict (same casefolded/NFC name, different content), Unavailable
      stale/missing-scope, and non-deployable pairs. Expected: counts and rows
      agree, alternate name or explicit Skip resolves each conflict, no Replace
      option exists, and the confirmation names the exact remote-write count.
- [ ] **The 20-write bound refuses rather than truncates or queues.** Select 21
      otherwise-ready fitting/character pairs. Expected: no ticket/start path,
      no POST, and an instruction to split the copy into batches of 20 or fewer.
      Reduce to 20 and re-review explicitly.
- [ ] **A real Personal Fittings create is additive.** Confirm a one-write copy
      to a live character, then inspect Personal Fittings in EVE. Expected: the
      selected fit was added with the chosen name and exact content; no existing
      fit was deleted, replaced, or renamed. Refresh after EVE's cache horizon
      and confirm the new presence becomes authoritative. There is no remote
      DELETE action anywhere in Wingman.
- [ ] **Partial results remain honest.** Run a batch where one ordinary
      deterministic rejection can be produced after one success. Expected:
      Success and Failed are separate per-pair results under one operation ID;
      the success remains on the character, later eligible pairs continue, and
      no rollback or automatic retry occurs.
- [ ] **Unknown is not Failed and cannot be retried early.** On a disposable
      test character/network, interrupt one create after send so no HTTP
      response reaches Wingman. Expected: **Unknown**, no Retry control, the
      pair unavailable to another preflight, and global Forget refused with a
      reconciliation instruction. Preserve `eve_fittings.json` before any
      further action as evidence.
- [ ] **Cache-horizon reconciliation requires a fresh authoritative `200`.**
      Refresh the Unknown character before five minutes: Unknown remains. A
      retained/`304` representation also leaves it unresolved. After more than
      five minutes from the persisted send time, refresh again; the request must
      be unconditional. A valid `200` showing the fit resolves to Success and
      presence; a valid `200` proving absence clears the unresolved block. Only
      then may preflight or Forget proceed. Record any inability to force these
      network/cache states as unverified, never as passed.
- [ ] **Cancellation stops before the next request.** Start a multi-pair batch
      and cancel while one request is active. Expected: that attempted pair gets
      its real outcome, every not-yet-sent pair reads Cancelled, the completed
      count is honest, and no later POST appears in network/log evidence.
- [ ] **Fitting-bucket throttle stops the remainder.** Against a disposable
      setup capable of returning fitting `429` (or a controlled ESI seam in a
      Windows test build), confirm the triggering pair and every remaining pair
      read **Unattempted due to throttle** and no automatic retry occurs. If a
      real throttle cannot be produced safely, leave this item explicitly
      unverified; a `?dev=1` result proves presentation only.

### Forget, restart and release integration

- [ ] **Forget from Settings > Characters is global and preserves curated
      library content.** Use Settings > Characters to forget one character
      after both Skills and Fittings have data for it. Expected: complete
      cleanup removes the shared credential, Skills snapshot, fitting
      snapshot and that character's presence, while independent library
      entries, aliases, collections and other characters remain. Re-adding
      requires EVE sign-in. Restart after the durable removal and verify no
      orphan credential or presence resurrects.
- [ ] **Forget from Settings > Characters distinguishes complete, partial,
      and refused cleanup.** Exercise all three outcomes on a character that
      both Skills and Fittings know about. Expected: complete cleanup
      removes the shared credential and both feature snapshots; partial
      cleanup removes the row but leaves re-add blocked until
      reconciliation proves what survived; refused cleanup leaves the row,
      keeps the shared credential, and leaves both feature snapshots intact
      with a refusal explaining why cleanup cannot proceed yet.
- [ ] **Forget from Settings > Characters waits for active work and blocks on
      ambiguity.** Start a fitting refresh or POST, switch to Settings >
      Characters, and press Forget on that same character. Expected:
      Forget does not race the request. A definite completed outcome
      permits ordered credential-first cleanup; an Unknown outcome refuses
      cleanup. In a multi-pair batch, forgetting between pairs prevents
      every later POST for that character.
- [ ] **Every durable boundary survives restart.** Repeat restart checks after
      full authorization, successful import, metadata edit, collection create/
      rename/delete, membership change, supersession, definite copy result,
      Unknown creation, reconciliation, and global Forget. The UI must never
      show an in-memory success that disappears or becomes retryable after
      restart; a surviving `in_flight` intent must reopen as Unknown.
- [ ] **The EVE gate cuts every route into Fittings.** With no Fittings work in
      flight, turn off **Show the EVE tools**. Expected: Profiles, Skills and
      Fittings disappear, the current and remembered destination repair to the
      Uploader, and the gear cannot return to a hidden route. Turn the gate back
      on and confirm local library state is unchanged.
- [ ] **Installed assets include the complete Fittings route.** In the frozen
      install, verify `_internal\web\fittings.js` exists beside `app.js` and
      `skills.js`, then open Fittings offline. Expected: local persisted content
      renders; a missing script produces an inert/blank route and is a release
      blocker even if the installer build succeeded.
- [ ] **Fittings spacing at 100%, 125%, 150%, and 200% scaling.** At each
      Windows display scaling factor, restart, open Fittings, and shrink the
      window to the 840x625 floor. Expected: the left inset, rail width, rail/
      content gap, and `Copy selected` placement stay intact, with no overlap,
      clipped action, or horizontal overflow.
- [ ] **Four-destination title-bar geometry holds at every supported scaling.**
      At 100%, 125%, 150% and 200%, restart, shrink to the 840x625 logical floor,
      and record CSS-pixel rectangles for titlebar, drag region, nav, gear,
      minimize and close. Expected at each: `scrollWidth == clientWidth`, close
      right edge inside titlebar, drag width at least 105 CSS px, and Uploader,
      Profiles, Skills and Fittings fully visible. Also drag by the remaining
      wordmark area and use every window control. Headless Chromium measurements
      in `DESIGN.md` are not a substitute for this Windows/WebView2 pass.

## EVE skill plan readiness

Requires a Windows machine, a real EVE account, and a registered EVE
application. Most of this subsystem IS covered by pytest — the parser, the
evaluator, the JWT verifier, the loopback parser, the ESI client, the state
normaliser and the skill-id cache all run headless on Linux in CI. What
follows is only what the suite structurally cannot reach: a live third-party
authorisation server, a browser, a Windows-only crypto API, and a frozen
bundle.

**Register the EVE application first.** Until someone creates it at
EVE Developers, sets the redirect URI to
`http://127.0.0.1:51779/callback/`, accepts the four scopes declared in
`wingman/eveauth/application.py`, and puts the client id there, none of the
SSO items below can run at all — Settings > Characters keeps authentication
disabled and says this build has no EVE application id configured. Every module
below the auth stack is testable with stubs before that happens, which is why
the rest of the feature can be built and merged against a placeholder id; only
these items are blocked on the registration.

### The SSO round trip

- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: a real authorisation completes against CCP.** In
      Settings > Characters, press **Authenticate character…**. Expected: the
      default browser opens EVE's own login page, the consent screen names
      exactly `esi-fittings.read_fittings.v1`,
      `esi-fittings.write_fittings.v1`, `esi-skills.read_skills.v1`, and
      `esi-skills.read_skillqueue.v1`, and after approving, **the browser tab
      shows Wingman's dark **Authorization received** page, with the purple
      success mark and no unstyled white-page flash, connection error, or raw
      JSON blob. The page says Wingman will finish connecting the character and
      that the tab can be closed. The returned character appears in Settings >
      Characters; Skills then shows it as `Unscored` until plans are evaluated.
      Nothing in the suite can reach login.eveonline.com, so this is the only
      proof the PKCE challenge, the state comparison, the loopback listener and
      the code exchange all agree with the live server.
- [ ] **A refused authorisation looks and behaves like failure.** Start another
      authorisation and deny it at EVE's consent screen. Expected: the callback
      tab shows Wingman's dark **Authorization not accepted** page with the red
      failure mark and tells the user to return to Wingman and try again. No
      character is added, and the app reports the refusal rather than waiting
      for the five-minute timeout.
- [ ] **The window stays responsive for the whole five minutes.** Start an
      authorisation and do not complete it. Drag the window, switch routes,
      scroll the recording list. If any of that freezes, the loopback wait
      is running on the bridge thread rather than a worker.
- [ ] **Cancel sign-in actually cancels.** Start an authorisation, click
      `Cancel sign-in`, then complete the login in the browser anyway. No
      character is added, and starting a second authorisation works — a
      listener that did not release port 51779 makes the second attempt
      fail to bind.
- [ ] **A second authorisation while one is in flight is refused, not
      queued.** Two would fight over the fixed port.

### DPAPI, on Windows only

- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: the refresh token survives a restart.** Authenticate a
      character, quit Wingman fully (tray Quit, not just closing the window),
      relaunch, and click `Refresh characters` in Skills or Fittings. It
      refreshes without asking you to sign in again. This is the DPAPI round
      trip: `dpapi.py` is the one module CI never executes, because it is
      `CryptProtectData` and CI is Linux.
- [ ] **A token another user cannot read costs one character, not the file.**
      Open `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FlyGD Wingman\eve_authority.json`, corrupt one
      character's `refresh_token_blob` (change a few base64 characters), and
      relaunch. Expected: that character shows Sign in / needs attention in
      Settings > Characters and the Skills row points back to Settings; **every
      other character is untouched and still refreshes.** This is what keeping
      the roster metadata in plaintext beside the wrapped token buys.

### A live refresh

- [ ] **An account with more than one character refreshes all of them.**
      Authorize at least three, click `Refresh characters`, and watch the notices
      strip count `Refreshed 1 of 3`, `2 of 3`, `3 of 3` as it goes. A
      counter that jumps straight to the total means progress is being
      pushed after the loop rather than per character.
- [ ] **A failure isolates.** Disconnect the network mid-refresh. Expected:
      the characters already fetched keep their data and show no error; the
      rest carry a per-character error and a `Stale` badge if they had
      previous data. Nothing shows a `Stale` badge that never fetched
      successfully.
- [ ] **Last-good data survives.** Reconnect, refresh again, and confirm the
      errors clear and the badges disappear.
- [ ] **The readiness verdict matches the game.** Pick one character and one
      plan and check three requirements against the in-game skill sheet: one
      it has active, one it is training, one it lacks. The evaluator's
      precedence is unit-tested; that the *inputs* are the right ESI fields
      is not.

### Settings > Characters cleanup and re-add

- [ ] **Forget is one write and it sticks.** In Settings > Characters, open
      the character's More menu, use `Forget character`, and confirm. The
      row disappears. Quit and relaunch: it is still gone, and no orphaned
      token remains — grep the state file for its character id and find
      nothing.
- [ ] **A forgotten character can be added back.** Re-authorise the same
      character from Settings > Characters. It returns as a single row, not
      a duplicate.
- [ ] **Forget during a refresh stays forgotten.** Start a refresh over
      several characters in Skills or Fittings, then forget one from
      Settings > Characters while it is in flight. It must not reappear
      when the refresh commits.

### Corruption recovery

- [ ] **A truncated state file recovers from `.bak`.** With at least two
      characters authorised and at least two refreshes done (so a `.bak`
      exists), quit Wingman, truncate `eve_skills.json` to a few bytes, and
      relaunch. Expected: the roster comes back from
      `eve_skills.json.bak`, a warning appears in the notices strip, the
      damaged file is preserved as `eve_skills.json.corrupt-<timestamp>`,
      and **the characters still refresh** — meaning the wrapped tokens came
      back with them. If they all need re-authenticating, the backup tier
      is not covering the tokens and the whole reason it exists is missing.
- [ ] **A corrupt skill-id cache costs a re-resolve, not a failure.** Delete
      `eve_skills_cache.json` and refresh. It rebuilds from ESI; readiness
      is unchanged afterwards.

### The Skills page itself

- [ ] **The two-pane layout renders sanely** on first open. The rail on the
      left, the roster on the right, no overlap, no horizontal scrollbar at
      the default window size.
- [ ] **No `unknown bridge handler` throws in the console.** Open devtools,
      click the Skills nav button, and watch the console while the page
      loads and while every button on it is clicked once. A throw here
      means a JS call names a handler the Python `Api` does not expose —
      `WM.handle`'s try/catch keeps that from crashing the page, but it
      should never fire at all in a build that matches its own bridge.
- [ ] **The counts line and the plan ratio agree, and the ratio is
      keyed.** With at least one character and one plan, confirm the rail's
      counts line reads `N characters added` — the whole roster, and
      scoped, because a group head 200px away says `3 characters` about a
      readiness group and the two used to be word-for-word identical
      (round 5's S3). Then confirm each plan row's ratio is `ready
      characters / all characters`, whose denominator is that same roster
      count, not a count of the plan's skills.
      The `READY` header sits over that column, and hovering a plan row
      spells both numbers out. The pane header's `N requirements` beside it
      counts the plan's skills and is a different quantity: with a roster
      and a plan of similar size the two are easy to read as one, which is
      what the header and the tooltip exist to prevent.
- [ ] **The plan-issues disclosure opens and closes.** A character not
      fully ready for a plan shows a collapsed `<details>` listing the
      missing requirements; expanding it does not shift the rest of the
      row list, and collapsing it again restores the original height.
- [ ] **Visual layout at the window floor.** Drag the window to its floor
      and check that long character and plan names ellipsise rather than
      overflowing, the rail's buttons do not clip their own labels, and
      there is no horizontal scrollbar. The rail is 214px and the roster
      keeps the rest.
      **This item used to send you to 150% scaling for "a 560px CSS
      viewport, where the rail narrows to 168px", and to 125% for 672px.**
      Neither viewport exists — the floor is 840 CSS px at every scaling —
      so the narrowed-rail states are unreachable through the window and
      840 is not "the one width where this layout was never in doubt", it
      is the only width there is.
- [ ] **The row separators stop at the answer, not at the pane edge.** Widen
      the window well past the floor and look at the character list. Expected:
      every status sits in one column, and the hairline under each row ends a
      short way past the longest status — the rest of the pane to its right
      is plain background, with no rule running across it. Expand a row: the
      requirement names and their states line up with the character names and
      statuses above, and the wider window does not push either column right.
      Round 3's S8: the pane is elastic and the content is not (the name
      column is capped at 240px on purpose, because that is what the longest
      EVE skill and character names need), so a full-width rule made the dead
      space read as an unfinished table rather than as margin. The list now
      takes its width from the row instead. If the statuses ever go ragged,
      the cause is the name column being sized by `max-width` rather than by
      `width` — the cap only aligns them while there happens to be room.
- [ ] **The rail's plan-file actions still work where they now sit.**
      `Open plans folder` and `Reload plans` are link-style actions at the
      foot of the Plans block rather than buttons in a block of their own.
      Both still do what they say; neither wraps off the rail at 150%
      scaling.
- [ ] **`What is a plan?` sits under the plans, not under the void**
      (round 5's S5). With two or three plans in the folder, look at the
      rail: the disclosure and the two plan-file actions follow the last
      plan row directly, and the rail's leftover space is BELOW them. It
      used to be the other way round — the list took the slack and pinned
      the only onboarding copy on the screen to the bottom of a ~620px
      gap.
- [ ] **`What is a plan?` opens without pushing anything off the rail.**
      Expand it. With few plans it simply pushes the actions down into the
      slack; with enough plans to fill the rail (eight or more) the plan
      list shrinks and scrolls instead, and the actions stay on screen.
      Check the second case at the window floor — that is the one the
      list's `min-height: 0` exists for. Collapse it again and the list
      returns to its height.
- [ ] **The plan-file actions sit directly below the plan list, above
      `What is a plan?`.** With plans present, read down the Plans block:
      the list, then `Open plans folder` / `Reload plans`, then the `What
      is a plan?` disclosure last. They act on the folder the list above
      them reads from, so they no longer wait behind an explanation almost
      nobody opens. Reordering costs no height: `<details>` and the
      actions row are both `flex: none` siblings of the same shrinkable
      list, so the four-plan-row floor measured against the block is
      unaffected.
- [ ] **The roster has its own persistent heading, like Groups and Plans.**
      Above the filter bar and the character list, a `Characters` heading
      (the route's own vocabulary — Manage characters, Filter characters, N
      characters added) sits in the same `.rail-head` treatment the Groups
      and Plans blocks already use, with only a hairline boundary added.
      It is inert text — no tabindex, no click handler — confirming the
      roster is the third of the rail's three independent scroll regions,
      not the one region with no label above its own scrollbar.
- [ ] **A collapsed row's missing-skill names stay legible at a glance.**
      With a character missing three or more skills for the selected plan,
      its collapsed roster row shows at most two names before `and N
      more` — a smaller cap than the plan-issues disclosure's own list
      (which spells out every requirement) and smaller again than the copy
      confirm dialog's name cap, because a roster row is scanned in
      passing across many rows rather than opened and read like a dialog.
      Confirm the `N` in `and N more` matches the character's real missing
      count minus the two names shown, not the number of names the
      payload happened to include.
- [ ] **An empty roster names the control.** With no characters authorised,
      the roster reads `No characters yet. Press “Manage characters…” to
      authenticate one in Settings.` — the name on the button, not a direction
      to look left.
- [ ] **The unscored group does not blame the wrong thing.** Empty the
      plans folder and reload plans. Every character collapses into one
      group; its heading is `Not scored yet` and the hint beside the roster
      says there are no local plans. The heading must NOT say the roster
      needs refreshing — refreshing is not what is missing, and it is the
      control the user would otherwise reach for.
- [ ] **Typing in the filter box narrows the roster live**, and the
      `Clear filter` action appears only while a filter is active and
      removes it when clicked.
- [ ] **A small roster opens expanded** (round 5's S1). With six or fewer
      characters, open Skills from cold. Expected: every row is already
      open, so the requirement lists are on screen without hunting for a
      chevron, and the pane does not waste most of its height on collapsed
      rows. Collapse a row, leave the route and come back: it stays
      collapsed. The expansion is one-shot, on the first payload that
      carries anyone; it must not re-open rows you closed.
- [ ] **A large roster does not.** With seven or more characters, the same
      cold open leaves every row collapsed — the cap is about how many
      requirement evaluations the page orders without being asked, and a
      fleet-sized roster did not ask for one each.
- [ ] **Expanding a row shows the right pieces together:** the `Stale`
      badge (if any), a re-authenticate banner placed above the
      requirements list (not interleaved with them), and the outstanding
      requirements list with any already-Active skills absent from it.
- [ ] **Every number on the screen says what it counts** (round 3, S1).
      A group head reads `Missing requirements   1 character`, not
      `Missing requirements   1`. That number counts CHARACTERS while the
      header names REQUIREMENTS, and the row below it and the plan heading
      above it both state requirement counts — three numbers in one
      vocabulary, previously two of them bare. Round 2's finding 2 renamed
      the words and left the numbers, so check the numbers.
- [ ] **No row repeats the heading it sits under** (round 3, S2). The rows
      are grouped BY status, so a `Ready` group's rows say only a name, and
      an `Untrained requirements` group's rows say only a name. The two
      that still carry a value carry something the heading cannot: a
      `Missing` row says `2 requirements` (which is also why its group
      sorts fewest-first) and a `Training` row says the ETA alone,
      `13h 25m` or `timing unknown`. The catch-all bucket is the deliberate
      exception — its rows show the raw readiness string, because the
      heading says `Unrecognised` for all of them.
- [ ] **Skills hands character management off to Settings > Characters.**
      Expand a row and inspect the rail action and any empty/reauth copy.
      Expected: Skills explains that authorization and forgetting live in
      Settings > Characters, and it does not render inline auth or forget
      controls of its own.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: a character's fetch line survives a second render**
      (round 3, D3/S6). Expand a character that HAS been refreshed and
      confirm it reads `Last fetched 5h ago`. Then cause any mutation that
      pushes fresh state — press `Refresh characters`, or select a
      different plan — and look again. It must still read a time. Until
      D3's fix, the label was added by the `skills_state` method only, the
      page asks for that on first entry only, and every render after the
      first push printed `Never fetched` for every character, beside queue
      timing from the same payload. Nothing in the suite renders the page
      and the bridge contract test checks handler names rather than payload
      shape, so this item is what stands between that and a release.
- [ ] **A character with no snapshot explains itself and offers the fix**
      (round 3, S6). Authorise a character and expand its row BEFORE any
      refresh has landed. Expected: a note saying Wingman has not read its
      skills from EVE yet, with a `Refresh characters` button in it — not a
      bare `Never fetched` with the nearest control 700px away in the rail.
      The requirement list under it must say `Not scored yet`, NOT `Nothing
      outstanding — every requirement is trained and active`: the evaluator
      returns an empty requirement list for a character it could not score,
      and that congratulation is what the empty list used to read as.
- [ ] **`Copy plan` puts the plan on the clipboard** (round 3, S7). With a
      plan selected, press `Copy plan` on the pane heading and paste into a
      text editor. Expected: one `Skill Name IV` line per requirement, in
      roman numerals, in plan order, and a local `Plan copied to clipboard.`
      status beneath the heading. Deny clipboard permission (or use a browser
      context that denies it) and confirm that same local status says
      `Could not copy the plan to the clipboard.` rather than failing silently
      or changing plan state. Then paste it into EVE's skill plan import and
      confirm the game accepts it and drops the skills already trained (that
      is why the whole plan is enough and no per-character diffing is done).
      With no plan selected the button is disabled rather than absent.
- [ ] **The Settings handoff is immediate, not an armed destructive
      control.** From Skills, activate `Manage characters…`. Expected:
      Settings opens on Characters immediately; there is no inline two-step
      forget state left behind on the Skills row.
- [ ] **`?dev=1` with the catch-all bucket renders, including the
      unrecognised readiness value.** Launch with `?dev=1` appended to the
      URL. `dev.js`'s character id 9 has readiness `'Ascendant'`,
      deliberately a value the UI does not recognise. **This character MUST
      still render a row** rather than being silently dropped or breaking
      the rest of the list — that is the lockout guard: an unrecognised
      readiness value from a future API change must degrade to an unstyled
      bucket, not vanish the row a user still needs to inspect and manage
      from Settings > Characters.
- [ ] **`DEV.skillsAuth(true)` and `DEV.skillsProgress(3, 9)` behave in a
      live browser**, not just in reasoning: with `?dev=1` loaded, run each
      from devtools and confirm the roster and progress indicator update
      as their names imply.
- [ ] **`Reload plans` and `Open plans folder` both actually work.** Drop a
      new `.txt` plan file into the plans folder, click `Reload plans`, and
      confirm it appears in the rail with the right requirement count.
      Then click `Open plans folder` and confirm the OS shell opens the
      correct directory. This second check is in the same failure family
      as the WebView2 items above it: `os.startfile` cannot be exercised in
      CI at all, so nothing but a human clicking the button proves the
      folder that opens is the one plans actually load from.
- [ ] **Selecting a different plan actually re-targets everything.** With
      two plans present, select the plan that is not already selected.
      Expected: the roster regroups against the new plan's requirements,
      the ready ratio in the rail updates for the new plan, and — if a row
      was already expanded — its requirement list re-fetches and shows the
      **newly selected plan's** requirements, not the previous plan's. This
      last part is the one to watch closely: a stale in-flight fetch
      resolving after the switch and rendering under the wrong plan is a
      silent bug — the row looks populated and correct, but every
      requirement on it belongs to the plan you left.
- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: the roster group order is exactly right.** Launch
      with `?dev=1` (it seeds one character per bucket) and confirm the
      groups appear top to bottom in this order: `Ready`, `Training`,
      `Locked`, `Missing`, `Unknown`, `Unscored`, then the catch-all
      bucket last. Nothing under `tests/` exercises this grouping at
      all — it lives entirely in `skills.js` — so this item is the only
      thing standing between a regression here and a release. A silent
      reorder would not error or throw; it would just be wrong, and
      nothing else in this checklist or the suite would catch it.
- [ ] **`Missing` sorts by training time, not by requirement count.**
      Same `?dev=1` roster. Confirm the `Missing` group reads top to
      bottom: Nera Tal (`1h 30m`), Aveline Castellane (`2d 0h`), Zara
      Castellane (`2d 0h`), Konstantina Alexandrovna Winterbourne
      (`7d 0h`), Gustav Oswaldo (`15d 0h`), then Petra Ilyenko last with
      no duration shown at all. Aveline before Zara is the deliberate
      tie-break: the fixture gives the two characters the identical raw
      `172800` seconds on purpose, so the sort can only separate them by
      falling through to character name — and it must do that on the RAW
      seconds, never on a text comparison of the rendered `2d 0h` label,
      which would not even distinguish the tie. A character with no
      usable estimate (Petra: confirmed but unusable attributes) sorts
      last regardless of how few requirements it is missing, the same
      way a `Training` row with no queue finish sorts last below.
- [ ] **`Training` sorts by real queue finish, not by name.** Same
      roster. Confirm the order is Zuelo Parvi (finishes 2026-08-25),
      Bel Ansgar (finishes 2026-08-27, later, despite sorting
      alphabetically before Zuelo), then Kaska Rin last. Kaska's own
      queue is `queue_timing_unknown`, so it has no finish to compare —
      and her row still shows her OWN plan-wide training estimate
      (`1d 2h`) beside `timing unknown`, because that is a different
      computation (training.estimate() over the whole plan) from EVE's
      queue-finish fact, and the missing fact must not borrow the
      other's number to fake a sort position.
- [ ] **A mixed row's duration includes SP already queued.** Still
      `?dev=1`, expand Konstantina Alexandrovna Winterbourne
      (`queued_count: 2`, `missing_count: 3`). Confirm her status line
      reads `3 unqueued · 7d 0h training remaining` — the duration is
      the WHOLE plan's remaining SP, not just the three unqueued skills,
      because `training.estimate()` is handed every requirement in the
      plan and only zeroes a skill's own contribution once ITS SP
      threshold is met, queued or not. If a future change scoped the
      estimate to `missing_names` alone, this row's duration would read
      shorter than the plan will actually take, silently.
- [ ] **`Stale` still carries a full training estimate.** Expand Gustav
      Oswaldo (`stale: true`, last refresh failed). Confirm the `Stale`
      badge sits beside his name AND the status line still reads a real
      duration — `6 unqueued · 15d 0h training remaining` — rather than
      falling back to `training time unavailable`. The estimate is
      scored against the LAST successful refresh, which is exactly what
      stale data is, not against the failed one.
- [ ] **The estimate assumptions live only in the tooltip, never as
      permanent copy.** With a plan selected, confirm no sentence about
      Omega speed, current attributes, implants or unlisted requirements
      is printed anywhere on the page by default. Hover the ⓘ button
      beside the plan heading: the tooltip `Estimates use current
      attributes at Omega speed. Implants and requirements not listed in
      this plan are excluded.` appears, and clears when the mouse moves
      away. Tab to the same button instead: the identical tooltip
      appears on keyboard focus alone, with no hover. Press Escape while
      it is focused: the tooltip is dismissed but focus visibly stays on
      the button — it must not move to the next control. Tab away and
      back (or click elsewhere, then click or Tab back to the button):
      the tooltip reopens. A suppression that survived a real blur would
      mean the button permanently omitted its own explanation for the
      rest of the session.
- [ ] **No plan selected, and a character whose attributes were never
      confirmed, both avoid a misleading zero.** Clear the plan
      selection: every roster row becomes `Unscored` and carries no
      status line at all — not `0 unqueued` and not `0m` — because an
      empty `training_estimate_status` means no estimate was ever asked
      for (Task 5's ruling), never a fifth failure worth a phrase.
      Reselect a plan and expand Petra Ilyenko
      (`attributes_unavailable` — the same outcome a pre-attributes
      build produces for a character it has never confirmed attributes
      for). Confirm her status reads `4 unqueued · training time
      unavailable`, never `4 unqueued · 0m training remaining`: `0m` is
      `training.estimate()`'s real answer for an already-trained target
      and must never stand in for a number the estimator could not
      compute at all.
- [ ] **At the 840x625 floor, long names still read as themselves and
      every collapsed status stays on one line.** Drag the window to its
      floor with `?dev=1` loaded. Confirm Konstantina Alexandrovna
      Winterbourne's name ellipsises at the 240px name-column cap rather
      than overflowing or wrapping: `text-overflow: ellipsis` truncates
      from the end, so enough of the PREFIX stays visible to tell her
      apart from every other row at a glance — `.skills-name` carries no
      `title`, so this is the only identity the collapsed row offers, not
      a fallback for a full string recoverable on hover. Then confirm the
      roster's worst case for the status column: Gustav Oswaldo, whose
      `Stale` badge and `6 unqueued · 15d 0h training remaining` status
      sit on the same line as his name. Neither wraps to a second line,
      neither is cut off without an ellipsis, and the badge and status do
      not overlap the name or each other — the chevron, badge and status
      are all `flex: none`, so the name column is the only thing that
      gives way, and this row is where it has to give way the most.
- [ ] **The Groups block sits above Plans and its list stays capped.**
      With `?dev=1`'s seeded groups, confirm the rail lists `All` followed
      by every seeded group, top to bottom, each member count matching the
      fake roster (`All` carries the whole roster's count) — above the
      Plans block, not below it, where `.rail-plans-block`'s `flex: 1`
      would pin Groups to the rail floor under a dead gap. Click a group:
      the highlight moves and `Rename`/`Delete` enable; click `All` and
      they disable again. This item only checks the rail's placement, the
      selection control, and the cap — the roster's and Plans list's
      response to the selection are covered by the Character groups items
      below. Then, at the 840x625 floor with nine or more groups (fake
      extra ones in devtools if the harness does not have that many),
      confirm the Plans list still shows at least four rows:
      `.rail-groups`'s `max-height` exists precisely so a long Groups list
      cannot starve the screen's primary list down to one row behind a
      scrollbar.
- [ ] **Character groups: create, select, persist.** Expand a character, set
      **Group → New group…**, name it, then add a second character to it
      from its own row. The rail's Groups list shows it with the right
      member count.
- [ ] **Character groups: selection scopes the screen.** Select the group.
      The roster narrows to its members, every plan ratio's denominator
      becomes the group's size, and the count line reads `N of M
      characters`.
- [ ] **Character groups: survive a restart.** Restart Wingman. The group
      and the selection are both still there.
- [ ] **Character groups: rename, and rename-onto-merge.** Rename the
      selected group. The selection follows the new name rather than
      dropping to All. Rename one group onto another's name: a merge is
      confirmed first, and confirming leaves one group holding both crews.
- [ ] **Character groups: delete.** Delete a group. Its members stay on the
      roster, ungrouped, and the screen falls back to All.
- [ ] **Character groups: empties itself out.** Move the last member out of
      a group. The rail loses the group and the screen falls back to All.

### Hide previews while you are not in EVE

Nothing automated covers any of this. `_apply_visibility` is the only
place a preview is hidden, and no test in the suite creates a real window
— the host tests drive fakes that record a flag.

- [ ] **The default is unchanged.** Fresh install, or a settings file
      predating the key. Expected: `Hide every preview while you are not
      in EVE` is UNTICKED and previews behave exactly as before. Absent
      must read as off; `!== false` — the read the on-by-default boxes
      (Show labels, Snap, Keep the same shape) use — would blank the
      screen of every upgrading install, which is why the wm:settings
      listener uses `=== true` here.
- [ ] **It hides, and it comes back.** Tick it, then click a browser or
      Discord. Expected: every preview leaves the screen at once. Click an
      EVE client: they all come back, in the same positions, without a
      flicker of re-placement — they were hidden, not destroyed, so
      nothing is re-registered with DWM on the way back.
- [ ] **Coming back does not steal the foreground.** With the previews
      hidden, click an EVE client and immediately start typing. Expected:
      the keystrokes reach the client. `set_hidden` re-shows with
      `SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE`; a plain `SW_SHOW` would hand the foreground to
      a preview on every return, and these windows are `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`
      precisely so that never happens.
- [ ] **All clients minimized.** The literal request. Minimize every EVE
      client. Expected: the previews go with them. This needs no separate
      code path — a minimized window cannot hold the foreground — but it
      is the case the feature was asked for and deserves its own look.
- [ ] **Wingman itself does not count as away.** With the box ticked, open
      Wingman and go to Settings > Previews. Expected: the previews stay
      on screen and can still be dragged and resized. Strict parity with
      TriffView would hide them here; that would make the screen that
      arranges previews the one screen you cannot arrange them from.
      Check the tray menu and a confirm dialog too — ownership is resolved
      by process, so all three should behave the same.
- [ ] **Unticking is immediate.** With the previews hidden and Wingman
      focused, untick the box. Expected: the previews return on the spot,
      not up to 700ms later and not only after you click an EVE client.
      `restyle()` re-runs the visibility pass for exactly this: the person
      unticking it is by definition looking at Wingman, so a sweep-only
      path would keep hiding them and the box would look inert.
- [ ] **A client that logs in while previews are hidden stays hidden.**
      Tick the box, click a browser, then launch or log in another
      character. Expected: no lone preview appears. Windows are created
      visible, so the hide is re-applied every sweep rather than only when
      the answer changes.
- [ ] **An alert raised while hidden survives until you return.** Tick the
      box with alerts on and `persist_until_selected` at its default.
      Trigger an alert on a client while you are in a browser. Expected:
      nothing is visible while away, and the ring is there — still
      pulsing — when you click back into EVE. This is the feature's real
      cost, and the hint under the checkbox says so.

### The card's own shape

Nothing in the suite renders this page, so every item here is a rendering
behaviour a lexical guard cannot reach.

- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: previews off says it ONCE.** Settings > Previews,
      untick `Show live previews of running EVE clients`. Expected: exactly
      one new sentence appears — `Nothing below is in effect yet — these
      apply when you turn previews back on.` — inside the master block,
      above the rule, and the card grows by about one line (26px measured
      in the harness at the 840 floor). NOT under Show-the-character-name,
      opacity, Snap, Keep-the-same-shape, Minimize and Hide as well: that
      is the state this replaced, six copies of one sentence, four of them
      visible at once. Tick it again and the line must GO, not linger.
- [ ] **Every control below stays live while it is off.** Same state: tick
      Snap, drag the opacity slider, type a default size. Expected: all of
      them work and persist. Recording a preference for later is an action
      that can be carried out, and the line is what says so — nothing here
      is disabled.
- [ ] **A write failure still speaks for its own control.** The shared
      line replaced the DEPENDENCE note in each status slot, not the slot.
      With previews off and the settings file made unwritable, toggle
      Snap: the per-control message must still appear beside Snap.
- [ ] **Four groups, in order.** Expected, reading down: `APPEARANCE`,
      `PLACEMENT`, `SIZE AND SHAPE`, `WHEN YOU SWITCH AWAY` — small caps,
      dimmer and a step smaller than the card heading, each over a
      hairline. The last group holds the two controls that reach the REAL
      EVE window, which is why it is separate and why it is last.
- [ ] **An empty status row costs no line.** With everything healthy,
      the slots under `Show the character name` and under the opacity
      caption are blank and must occupy NO vertical space. Then force a
      message into one (a failed write): the row must appear, and vanish
      again when the message clears. `:empty` drives it, so nothing has to
      remember to clear a `hidden` attribute.
- [ ] **A raised-only note costs no line either, and this reaches three
      sections.** The same rule collapses a row whose hint is `[hidden]`
      rather than empty, so it also governs `#preview-binds-off`,
      `#alerts-previews-off`, `#alerts-no-folder`, `#alerts-depends` and
      Bookmarks' `#eve-blockers`. Walk Bookmarks, Previews and Alerts with
      each of those notes both raised and clear. Expected: no row ever
      shows blank, and no note ever fails to appear. The `hidden` case is
      the one the first draft of this rule missed — the row stayed a
      0-height flex item and still spent its 10px gap.
- [ ] **A live region keeps its line.** Settings > Alerts. `#alerts-health`
      and `#alerts-status` are `role="status"` and are deliberately NOT
      collapsed: a live region that is `display: none` when its text lands
      may never be announced. Expected: the `Watching gamelogs — …` line
      renders in place, and with a screen reader on, a change to it is
      spoken.
- [ ] **The roster card is as wide as its table and no wider.** Settings >
      Previews at the character list, window at its default size.
      Expected: the keybinds card is wider than the card above it but not
      full-width — measured 673 against 620 at 1015 CSS — with `Size…`
      landing near its right edge rather than stranded mid-card. A
      full-pane card here is the regression: this table has fixed tracks,
      so the width it does not use becomes dead space inside every row.
- [ ] **A long character name is not clipped at the default size.**
      Expected: names up to roughly 20 characters render whole. The column
      is `minmax(150px, 260px)` — both ends lengths, so it still cannot
      move between sessions with whoever is logged in, which is what round
      3's B1 forbade. A genuinely extreme name still ellipsizes and still
      carries the full string in its `title`.
- [ ] **Neither width overflows.** At the 840x625 floor and at the default
      size, `document.documentElement.scrollWidth` must equal
      `clientWidth`. The roster card is `width: max-content` with
      `max-width: 100%`; the cap is what keeps the floor honest.
- [ ] **The word `offline` appears ONCE, over its own block.** Settings >
      Previews at the character list, with some clients running and some
      not. Expected: running characters first, then a single `OFFLINE`
      rule-and-heading, then the rest — every row under it dim, and NO
      per-row `offline` tag anywhere. On a fleet with nobody logged in the
      heading sits directly under the column headers and every row is
      below it. The dimming reinforces the heading; it is not the encoding
      on its own, which is the WCAG 1.4.1 failure this arrangement is the
      third attempt at.
- [ ] **The table labels and Offline heading cannot leave their rows.** Same
      screen, with a roster long enough that the offline block exceeds the
      pane — about 16 characters at the 840x625 floor, fewer if the window is
      shorter. Scroll to the bottom of the list. Expected: the four named
      column labels and the blank actions header remain pinned at the top of
      the pane; `OFFLINE` remains directly below them while one of its rows is
      visible; and neither sticky layer covers the other. A row cut by the
      current scroll position may emerge partially below `OFFLINE`; that is the
      normal edge of the opaque sticky layer, not overlap inside it. This is the
      whole reason both are sticky — a label that scrolls off the controls it
      explains recreates the original context-loss defect.
- [ ] **A conflict warning still names its owner once its row is behind the
      sticky headers.** Same scroll-to-bottom scenario, using a character
      whose direct bind collides with a cycle keybind (the dev fixture's
      Tanuki Solette, whose chord matches `All forward`). Scroll until her
      row sits fully or partly behind the column headers/`OFFLINE` heading
      while the warning directly below it is still visible. Expected: the
      warning's own sentence still opens with `Tanuki Solette: …` rather
      than assuming the row above it is on screen, and her `Keybind` button
      still points `aria-describedby` at that exact warning's id. Confirm
      with a screen reader or the accessibility pane: focusing the button
      announces its own label (the chord) followed by the description, and
      the description text alone still names the owner even though the row
      it explains may be hidden.
- [ ] **The rule above the column headers is one line, not four dashes.**
      `.row` is `display: contents` in this grid, so a border on the
      header CELLS is cut by every 10px column gap. It is drawn by an
      empty `.bind-group` spanning `1 / -1` instead. If you see gaps in
      that line at the gutters, the border has been moved back onto the
      cells.
- [ ] **`Preview` is centred over its checkbox.** The header word is 45px
      and the box is 15px; every other column's control is dead centre
      under its label, and this one was 15px left of it. Nothing else on
      the row moves.
- [ ] **The list says how to set a bind.** Above `All forward`:
      "Click a keybind and press the keys you want. Edit… lets you type
      one instead." Both halves are load-bearing — nothing else says the
      chord itself is clickable, and `Edit…` sits under a blank column
      header. The label is deliberately not renamed to explain itself
      (round 3's B6); the sentence is the fix.

### Frozen build

- [ ] **LOAD-BEARING: the installed build serves `skills.js`.** Install the
      built artifact, launch it, and click Skills. The rail renders, the
      buttons respond, and the roster fills. CI asserts the file exists at
      `_internal\web\skills.js`; only launching proves the page fetched and
      executed it. A route whose static markup renders and whose every
      control is inert is exactly what a missing script looks like —
      PyInstaller exits 0 when a `datas` entry resolves to nothing, and
      pywebview reports no error for a script that 404s.
- [ ] **The frozen EVE interaction reaches only CCP after startup traffic is
      excluded.** Start the installed build with an HTTPS capture running and
      wait for the automatic GitHub startup check to finish. Clear the capture
      after the automatic GitHub startup check finishes, then perform a Settings
      > Characters authorization or Skills refresh interaction and inspect a
      plan. Expected: only that EVE interaction contacts the network, and its
      hosts are `login.eveonline.com` and `esi.evetech.net`; there is no FlyGD,
      Google, Discord, or unrelated GitHub request in the cleared capture.

### Checking for and installing an update

- [ ] **Every deterministic dev state fits and is keyboard-operable.** From
      the checkout, serve the browser-only harness with
      `uv run python -m http.server 8765 --directory wingman/web`, set the
      browser viewport to 840x625, and open each of:

      ```text
      http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html?dev=1&update=idle
      http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html?dev=1&update=checking
      http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html?dev=1&update=current
      http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html?dev=1&update=unavailable
      http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html?dev=1&update=available
      http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html?dev=1&update=downloading
      http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html?dev=1&update=ready
      http://127.0.0.1:8765/index.html?dev=1&update=error
      ```

      Expected: each state has the documented status, progress, and button
      set; General's licence line, Start-on-login checkbox, and `msg-about`
      remain reachable; and no horizontal scrollbar appears. In every state,
      Tab reaches each visible action with a focus ring and Enter/Space behaves
      like a click. Repeat `downloading`, `ready`, and `error` in the real
      Windows WebView2 app; pytest never renders either path.
- [ ] **The automatic check is once per process, including hidden login
      starts.** With an HTTPS monitor filtered to
      `api.github.com/repos/elboaf/FlyGD-Wingman/releases/latest`, fully quit
      Wingman, launch it normally, and leave it running for five minutes.
      Expected: one non-blocking request after the page is ready and no polling.
      Quit, then launch the installed `Wingman.exe --hidden`; expected: exactly
      one request again even though no window opens. Opening General only reads
      the cached result and creates no request.
- [ ] **Current.** With no newer release published, Settings > General shows
      `Wingman is up to date.` and `Check again` is the only visible button.
- [ ] **Checking and manual retry.** Click `Check again`. Exactly one new API
      request occurs, the line reads `Checking for updates…`, and the button
      disables for the round trip. Repeated clicks cannot create concurrent
      requests.
- [ ] **Available.** With a newer stable release published, the card names the
      version and shows `Download update`; `Install update` stays hidden.
- [ ] **Automatic offline check fails quietly.** Disconnect networking and
      relaunch. No dialog, banner, badge, or retry stack appears; General reads
      the neutral `Update status unavailable.`, not a specific network error.
- [ ] **Manual failure names the stage.** With networking still down, click
      `Check again`. The card shows Python's stage-specific failure and leaves
      an explicit retry rather than the neutral automatic-failure sentence.
- [ ] **Progress.** Reconnect and click `Download update`. The download starts
      only now. Its progress bar is determinate from the first tick, advances
      to full, and the status reads `Downloading the update…` throughout.
- [ ] **Post-attachment mutation is rejected.** Let a real download reach
      `Update downloaded. Ready to install.`, decline its automatic install
      prompt, then alter the newest already-marked staging file:

      ```powershell
      $Ready = Get-ChildItem "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\FlyGD Wingman\tmp\updates\*.ready.exe" |
        Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1
      Add-Content -LiteralPath $Ready -Value "post-attachment mutation"
      ```

      Click `Install update`. Expected: no Setup process opens; the card says
      the installer changed or is unavailable, returns to a download-required
      state, and removes the invalid staged file. Do not run the altered file.
- [ ] **Declined install.** On a fresh valid download, `Install update?` pops
      automatically once. Cancel it. The card remains on `Update downloaded.
      Ready to install.` with `Install update` visible and enabled -- not
      reverted to `Download update` or stuck disabled.
- [ ] **Retained Install action confirms again.** Click `Install update`; the
      same confirm reappears. Accept it: the normal visible Inno installer
      appears before any upgrade proceeds. Windows may also show its unsigned-
      file reputation warning depending on policy and reputation; zone checks
      must remain enabled, and Attachment Services must retain Mark-of-the-Web
      where supported.
- [ ] **Active-upload and retry exclusion.** Start an upload, then try to
      install a staged update. Expected: `Finish the active upload before
      installing the update.`, no Setup process, and `Install update` remains
      available; after the upload finishes, normal install still works. On the
      Windows checkout also run:

      ```powershell
      uv run --no-sync python -m pytest tests/test_api_updates.py `
        -k "upload_and_handoff_race or retry_and_handoff_race or retry_refused_during_handoff" -v
      ```

      Expected: all selected cases pass, proving a claimed handoff also refuses
      both a new upload and Retry rather than racing launch or shutdown.
- [ ] **Tray Quit is refused in every handoff phase.** On Windows run:

      ```powershell
      uv run --no-sync python -m pytest `
        tests/test_api_quit.py::test_quit_is_refused_with_information_during_each_handoff_phase `
        tests/test_api_updates.py::test_quit_is_refused_during_each_handoff_phase -v
      ```

      Expected: both tests pass for `handing_off`, `revalidating`, and
      `launching`. During a real install handoff, choosing tray **Quit** must
      raise/show Wingman, report `Update installation is being prepared.`, and
      leave the app alive until the updater-owned orderly shutdown begins.
- [ ] **Shell-launch failure recovers without stranding Wingman.** Run the
      deleted-path `shell-launch` case in **Guided updater native harness** and
      the focused recovery cases:

      ```powershell
      uv run --no-sync python -m pytest tests/test_api_updates.py `
        -k "shell_failure_removes_marker_and_recovers_ready_state" -v
      ```

      Expected: no installer process, no handoff marker, Wingman remains
      responsive, the card returns to enabled `Install update`, and a later
      retry can succeed.
- [ ] **Gear tooltip and accessible name.** Before any check completes, the
      gear's accessible name reads `Settings`. Once an update is available,
      its title and accessible name read `Settings — update available`, and
      the dot survives opening Settings (the `.active` state does not erase
      it).

## Architecture remediation integration — native follow-up

These items are **unverified until exercised on Windows/WebView2**. Passing
pytest, the Node runtime harnesses, or a plain-browser render does not check
these boxes. Record the candidate SHA, Windows/display-scaling configuration,
scenario and observed result. Use disposable state, recording/profile trees,
and scripted transports or development fault injection for failure/race cases.
No live uploads, fitting writes or real profile overwrites are required here.
Never move or resize a real EVE client window.

- [ ] **Refused settings remain refused.** Inject a settings persistence failure
      while changing privacy and a folder. The control returns to its last
      accepted value, the error is inline, and the rejected value does not
      change upload privacy or rebind the watcher. Restart against the disposable
      state and confirm the previous saved value remains in effect.
- [ ] **Acknowledgements do not erase drafts.** Accept Category 22, submit an
      invalid value, and confirm refusal restores 22 even while focused. Repeat
      with a delayed accepted retry followed by a newer draft: the draft remains
      and the obsolete refusal clears. Another field's refusal and newer
      folder/webhook blur warnings must survive that acknowledgement.
- [ ] **Preview reads see committed preferences.** Delay and then fail a
      settings save while the native preview pump is active. Configuration
      callbacks keep returning committed values without waiting on persistence;
      rejected draft preferences never take effect. A successful retry publishes
      the new preferences without blocking the pump on disk work.
- [ ] **Fleet delivery cannot stall telemetry.** Delay Fleet presentation through
      a controlled development seam while telemetry continues. Other subscribers
      keep receiving updates. Release it: display catches up to the latest state
      and admitted seen-character history obeys the existing roster/cap policy.
- [ ] **Fleet replacement rejects stale continuations.** Disable/re-enable or
      close/recreate the bar with old delivery held. Release old work and confirm
      it cannot redirect to the replacement window. Exercise Quit with stalled
      delivery; the presentation-worker stop must remain bounded rather than
      waiting indefinitely for that delivery. Already-entered calls are not
      assumed cancellable.
- [ ] **Recording scans cannot roll the list back.** With distinct disposable
      folders, delay an old scan, switch folders, then release it. Only the newer
      accepted folder appears. Repeat a same-folder refresh with selection and
      a rename; old results must not restore obsolete row IDs or the old name.
- [ ] **Probe ownership survives refresh.** Delay an old drain after entry, start
      replacement work, then release it. Replacement duration answers arrive;
      the old callback cannot consume its queue or stop its scheduler. A late
      background answer cannot replace a definitive answer for the same row.
- [ ] **Completed-upload evidence does not wait on painting.** With a simulated
      successful upload, hold an unrelated row publication. Inspect the temporary
      link store before releasing it: the URL is already saved, including for an
      obsolete original row ID. Repeat across rename; the URL follows the correct
      captured file, while stale IDs cannot repaint replacement rows.
- [ ] **Authority cleanup stays ordered.** With scripted identities, overlap
      authority membership changes with participant reconciliation/refresh. Once
      removal completes, later stale work must not resurrect that character's
      Skills/Fittings data. No live account removal is needed for this case.
- [ ] **Fitting successes retain protection against cached absence.** Using a
      scripted successful write and subsequent reads, verify 304, cached and
      too-early absent responses do not permit a duplicate create or discard
      protective success evidence. Exercise the qualifying full-read rule in
      `docs/reference/fittings-write-evidence.md`, including restart and capacity
      refusal, without sending a real fitting POST.
- [ ] **Profiles rechecks safety after confirmation.** In a disposable profile
      tree, make a selected target unsafe while the confirmation is open, then
      accept. Confirm the unsafe target is not modified and the refusal is
      reported; stale pre-confirmation eligibility must not authorize a write.
- [ ] **Skills survives route/read/push races.** Delay initial hydration, leave
      and return, then deliver replies in the old order. The screen must recover
      rather than remain fetching. A newer push must survive an older read or
      null/failure response; detail selection must not revert to an old request.
- [ ] **Supplemental read failure does not become core failure.** Script valid
      Skills and queue responses followed by malformed attributes JSON or HTTP
      framing. Core readiness updates, whole-character/progress errors stay empty,
      and the retained attributes remain unconfirmed with a persisted supplemental
      error. Also check ordinary Skills/Fittings GET refresh and endpoint denial;
      endpoint 401/403 must not invalidate an otherwise valid shared grant.

**Known separate limitation:** the pre-existing refresh-during-foreground-probe
captured-duration gap (coordinator follow-up E-F1) is not fixed by the same-row
precedence check above. A green run here must not be reported as proving captured
upload-job, replacement-row and persisted-duration agreement across snapshots.

## Critique flow fixes — native follow-up

These checks remain **unverified on Windows/WebView2**. Browser fixtures exercise
page behavior and geometry, not native preview input or real remote writes. Use
scripted transports and disposable profile trees for failure cases. Check both
840×625 and the 839px floor observed at 200% scaling.

- [ ] **Fitting drafts stay with their fitting.** Edit a name and description,
      change a collection, collapse/reopen, filter away/back, and refresh.
      Neither field is saved implicitly or lost. Save explicitly with a delayed
      reply, type a newer draft, and confirm the acknowledgement preserves it.
      A refused save retains both fields for retry. Discard requires confirmation.
- [ ] **Copy outcomes remain reviewable.** Produce mixed success, present,
      unknown and failed results. Counts match rows; Unknown explains checking
      Personal Fittings in EVE and refreshing before a retry. Close and reopen
      Last copy results without sending another preflight or write. Start a
      second copy, leave during cancellation, and confirm its eventual result
      replaces the previous result without opening a dialog off-route. Results
      and unsaved metadata are session-only, not restart recovery.
- [ ] **Recovery identifies the actual archive.** In a disposable profile tree,
      fail replacement and rollback. View recovery backup opens Backups filtered
      to the archive actually created. Clearing the filter restores the list.
      A missing/unreadable archive falls back to the full list without invoking
      Restore; its path remains visible. Filename and displayed-date searches
      work. An unreadable store names its folder. Only a successful restore of
      the indicated archive clears the recovery context.
- [ ] **Previews can be revisited without a long scroll.** Each quick-navigation
      button lands on its card. While scrolling character rows and opening
      Configure, navigation, column headers and group headers do not cover each
      other or the opened detail. The gesture guide agrees with actual preview
      input: left-drag moves and right-drag resizes an unlocked preview. Dragging
      an unlocked preview with both buttons resizes every preview, including
      locked ones; locked previews ignore direct drag gestures. Never resize an
      EVE client itself.
- [ ] **Identities and estimates stay honest.** Formations shows the full loaded
      account near Save and on the account picker's tooltip. A pending or failed
      switch does not relabel the old document. Long Fleet bar names reveal their
      full text on hover. An elapsed Skills estimate says finish time passed,
      not ready in due or Ready; an estimate twenty seconds ahead says <1m.
