"""The js_api bridge: everything the page can call, everything Python pushes.

Two rules govern this module, and both are load-bearing.

**Methods only.** pywebview builds its JavaScript proxy by walking the
public attributes of this object. A public attribute holding a
`webview.Window` (or a `pystray.Icon`) sends that walk into the WinForms
native object, where `Rectangle.Empty` returns itself; it recurses until
`RecursionError` kills the process, roughly eight seconds after launch,
with nothing in the traceback naming the attribute responsible. Every
non-method attribute here is therefore underscore-prefixed, and
`test_api.py` asserts it rather than trusting anyone to remember.

**Workers use semantic push chokepoints.** Most call `_push`; the independent
Fleet page uses `_push_fleet_snapshot`. Both serialize a complete semantic
payload and call `evaluate_js`, which is safe from any thread; there is no UI
thread to marshal onto.

`_window` is assigned by ui.window.create() after construction rather than
passed in: create_window() needs js_api before a window object exists.

        `state_payload()` raw. skills.js asks for state on first entry only
        (it says so at skills.js:76-79 -- after that every mutation

        back structures the document still references, so a key written

        and `_push` into a hidden window is swallowed, so the dialog would
        never be seen and the wait would run to its timeout. Quit would
        look broken.

        is right for a worker and wrong here: this runs on the pystray
        thread, and parking it stops the whole tray menu.

        never answers, and the two failures are not symmetric -- reading
        silence as "stay running" costs a second click, reading it as
        "quit" costs the upload.

        the collision exists at all and why the split is not a filter. This
        is the same fact told from the other end: there, a bookmark chord
        that a preview will take; here, the preview chords that take one.

        NOT a straight mirror, and the asymmetry is the point rather than an
        oversight. _bookmark_chords() has to infer from configuration --
        AHK's `#HotIf WinActive` hotkey is not a RegisterHotKey
        registration, so Windows can report nothing about it and "enabled,
        with a window ticked" is the closest it can get. A preview chord IS
        a RegisterHotKey, so the host can say whether Windows actually
        granted it, and inferring from `preview.enabled` here would claim a
        bookmark had lost its key to a chord Windows refused.

        Three outcomes, not two, which is the same three previews.js's
        clashes() already distinguishes and for the same reason:

        - registered right now -> "active". The bookmark cannot fire while
          EVE is focused.
        - the host is not holding chords at all (previews off, or stopped)
          -> "latent". Nothing is taken yet and turning previews on would
          take it, which is exactly what the page says.
        - the host IS running and this chord is refused, or has not been
          reported on yet -> NEITHER. We cannot say a preview takes the key,
          and we cannot say turning previews on would, because they are on.
          An unmarked bind is the honest answer; previews.js surfaces the
          refusal on its own screen, where the user can act on it.

        Compared in display form, the common ground the two notations meet
        on: preview gestures are STORED in display form -- settings.py runs
        every one through preview.gestures.display() on load -- which is why
